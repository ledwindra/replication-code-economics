# About

In last March 2021, a friend of mine sent me a paper titled [The influence of hidden researcher decisions in applied microeconomics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecin.12992). Then I read the author's thread on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1374058480219213824). That leads me to the following question:

```
Is making replication code more of a norm or an exception to (micro/empirical)economists?
```

It may be true that there are public resources out there, but they may be scattered and not centralized in a place where communities can easily look up to, such as GitHub. It's not surprising that economists are not used to sharing stuffs on this place, but it looks like the numbers are growing recently.

So here's my attempt to nowcast total repositories using Stata that describe "replication code" in the keywords. From the figure below I am optimistic that open-sourcing research is becoming more increasing. In addition, it still doesn't count publicly available codes on elsewhere, such as GitLab, Bitbucket, journal websites, or the authors' academic/personal websites.

This repository is automatically updated on 12.00 AM UTC every day to nowcast this trend. The only metric that I use is numbers of public repositories that use Stata and have "replication code" in the keywords (not case sensitive).
