    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies asset pricing and labor market dynamics when idiosyncratic risk to human capital is not fully insurable. Firms use long\u2010term contracts to provide insurance to workers, but neither side can fully commit; furthermore, owing to costly and unobservable retention effort, worker\u2010firm relationships have endogenous durations. Uninsured tail risk in labor earnings arises as a part of an optimal risk\u2010sharing scheme. In equilibrium, exposure to the tail risk generates higher aggregate risk premia and higher return volatility. Consistent with data, firm\u2010level labor share predicts both future returns and pass\u2010throughs of firm\u2010level shocks to labor compensation.</jats:p>",
