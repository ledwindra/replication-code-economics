Our model incorporates distortionary frictions such as transaction taxes and commissions. When contracts are fully substitutable for firms, competitive equilibria exist and coincide with outcomes that satisfy a cooperative solution concept called \n            <jats:italic>trail stability</jats:italic>. However, competitive equilibria are generally neither stable nor Pareto\u2010efficient.\n          </jats:p>",
