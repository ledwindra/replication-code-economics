    "abstract": "<jats:p>We study discrete panel data methods where unobserved heterogeneity is revealed in a first step, in environments where population heterogeneity is not discrete. We focus on \n            <jats:italic>two\u2010step grouped fixed\u2010effects</jats:italic> (GFE) estimators, where individuals are first classified into groups using \n            <jats:italic>kmeans</jats:italic> clustering, and the model is then estimated allowing for group\u2010specific heterogeneity. Our framework relies on two key properties: heterogeneity is a function\u2014possibly nonlinear and time\u2010varying\u2014of a low\u2010dimensional continuous latent type, and informative moments are available for classification. We illustrate the method in a model of wages and labor market participation, and in a probit model with time\u2010varying heterogeneity. We derive asymptotic expansions of two\u2010step GFE estimators as the number of groups grows with the two dimensions of the panel. We propose a data\u2010driven rule for the number of groups, and discuss bias reduction and inference.\n          </jats:p>",
