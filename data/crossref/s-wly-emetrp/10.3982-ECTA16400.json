    "abstract": "<jats:p>Liver exchange has been practiced in small numbers, mainly to overcome blood\u2010type incompatibility between patients and their living donors. A donor can donate either his smaller left lobe or the larger right lobe, although the former option is safer. Despite its elevated risk, right\u2010lobe transplantation is often utilized due to size\u2010compatibility requirement with the patient. We model liver exchange as a market\u2010design problem, focusing on logistically simpler two\u2010way exchanges, and introduce an individually rational, Pareto\u2010efficient, and incentive\u2010compatible mechanism. Construction of this mechanism requires novel technical tools regarding bilateral exchanges under partial\u2010order\u2010induced preferences. Through simulations we show that not only can liver exchange increase the number of transplants by more than 30%, it can also increase the share of the safer left\u2010lobe transplants.</jats:p>",
