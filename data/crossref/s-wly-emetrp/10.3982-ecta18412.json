    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates whether the range of an attribute's outcomes in the choice set alters its relative importance. I derive distinguishing predictions of two prominent theories of range\u2010dependent attribute weighting: the focusing model of K\u0151szegi and Szeidl (2013) and the relative thinking model of Bushong, Rabin, and Schwartzstein (2021). I test these predictions in a laboratory experiment in which I vary the prices of high\u2010 and low\u2010quality variants of multiple products. The data provide clear evidence of choice\u2010set dependence consistent with relative thinking: price increases that expand the range of prices in the choice set lead to \n            <jats:italic>more</jats:italic> purchases. Structural estimates imply economically meaningful effect sizes: the average participant was willing to pay around 17% more when a seemingly irrelevant option is added to their choice set.\n          </jats:p>",
