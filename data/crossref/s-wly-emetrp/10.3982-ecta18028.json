First, I lay down some ideas on how one could extend the framework to model fragility traps that characterize many low\u2010income countries and study issues related to nation\u2010building, conflict, and heterogeneity across space and ethnic lines in the provision of public goods. Second, I discuss the relevance of the approach for the analysis of authoritarian populism that is spreading in developed countries and emerging markets.</jats:p>",
