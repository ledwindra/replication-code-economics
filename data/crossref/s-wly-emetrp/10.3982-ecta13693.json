    "abstract": "<jats:p>An Equivalence Theorem between geometric structures and utility functions allows new methods for understanding preferences. Our classification of valuations into \u201cDemand Types\u201d incorporates existing definitions (substitutes, complements, \u201cstrong substitutes,\u201d etc.) and permits new ones. Our Unimodularity Theorem generalizes previous results about when competitive equilibrium exists for any set of agents whose valuations are all of a \u201cdemand type.\u201d Contrary to popular belief, equilibrium is guaranteed for more classes of purely\u2010complements than of purely\u2010substitutes, preferences. Our Intersection Count Theorem checks equilibrium existence for combinations of agents with specific valuations by counting the intersection points of geometric objects. Applications include matching and coalition\u2010formation, and the \u201cProduct\u2010Mix Auction\u201d introduced by the Bank of England in response to the financial crisis.</jats:p>",
