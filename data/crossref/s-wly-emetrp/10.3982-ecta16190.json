    "abstract": "<jats:p>We introduce random evolving lotteries to study preference for non\u2010instrumental information. Each period, the agent enjoys a flow payoff from holding a lottery that will resolve at the terminal date. We provide a representation theorem for non\u2010separable risk consumption preferences and use it to characterize agents' attitude to non\u2010instrumental information. To address applications, we characterize \n            <jats:italic>peak\u2010trough</jats:italic> utilities that aggregate trajectories of flow utilities linearly but, in addition, put weight on the best (peak) and worst (trough) lotteries along each path. We show that the model is consistent with recent experimental evidence on attitudes to information, including a preference for gradual arrival of good news and the ostrich effect, that is, decision makers' tendency to prefer information after good news to information after bad news.\n          </jats:p>",
