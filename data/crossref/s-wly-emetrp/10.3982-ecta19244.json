    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies the impacts of managers in the administrative public sector using novel Italian administrative data containing an output\u2010based measure of productivity. Exploiting the rotation of managers across sites, I find that a one standard deviation increase in managerial talent raises office productivity by 10%. These gains are driven primarily by the exit of older workers who retire when more productive managers take over. I use these estimates to evaluate the optimal allocation of managers to offices. I find that assigning better managers to the largest and most productive offices would increase output by at least 6.9%.</jats:p>",
