    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides a general analysis of signaling under double\u2010crossing preferences with a continuum of types. There are natural economic environments where the indifference curves of two types cross twice, such that the celebrated single\u2010crossing property fails to hold. Equilibrium exhibits a threshold type below which types choose actions that are fully revealing and above which they pool in a pairwise fashion, with a gap separating the actions chosen by these two sets of types. The resulting signaling action is quasi\u2010concave in type. We also provide an algorithm to establish equilibrium existence by construction.</jats:p>",
