    "abstract": "<jats:p>Policymakers frequently use price regulations as a response to inequality in the markets they control. In this paper, we examine the optimal structure of such policies from the perspective of mechanism design. We study a buyer\u2010seller market in which agents have private information about both their valuations for an indivisible object and their marginal utilities for money. The planner seeks a mechanism that maximizes agents' total utilities, subject to incentive and market\u2010clearing constraints. We uncover the constrained Pareto frontier by identifying the optimal trade\u2010off between allocative efficiency and redistribution. We find that competitive\u2010equilibrium allocation is not always optimal. Instead, when there is inequality across sides of the market, the optimal design uses a tax\u2010like mechanism, introducing a wedge between the buyer and seller prices, and redistributing the resulting surplus to the poorer side of the market via lump\u2010sum payments. When there is significant same\u2010side inequality that can be uncovered by market behavior, it may be optimal to impose price controls even though doing so induces rationing.</jats:p>",
