    "abstract": "<jats:p>We test the longstanding hypothesis that ethnic groups organized around \u201csegmentary lineages\u201d are more prone to conflict. Ethnographic accounts suggest that in such societies, which are characterized by strong allegiances to distant relatives, individuals are obligated to come to the aid of fellow lineage members when they become involved in conflicts. As a consequence, small disagreements often escalate into larger\u2010scale conflicts involving many individuals. We test for a link between segmentary lineage organization and conflict across ethnic groups in sub\u2010Saharan Africa. Using a number of estimation strategies, including a regression discontinuity design at ethnic boundaries, we find that segmentary lineage societies experience more conflicts, and particularly ones that are retaliatory, long in duration, and large in scale.</jats:p>",
