    "abstract": "<jats:p>How can one determine whether a treatment, such as the introduction of a social program or trade shock, alters agents' incentives to form links in a network? This paper proposes analogs of a two\u2010sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, widely used in the literature to test the null hypothesis of no treatment effects, for network data. It first specifies a testing problem in which the null hypothesis is that two networks are drawn from the same random graph model. It then describes two randomization tests based on the magnitude of the difference between the networks' adjacency matrices as measured by the 2\u2009\u2192\u20092 and \u221e\u2009\u2192\u20091 operator norms. Power properties of the tests are examined analytically, in simulation, and through two real\u2010world applications. A key finding is that the test based on the \u221e\u2009\u2192\u20091 norm can be much more powerful for the kinds of sparse and degree\u2010heterogeneous networks common in economics.</jats:p>",
