    "abstract": "<jats:p>We propose a general and highly efficient method for solving and estimating general equilibrium heterogeneous\u2010agent models with aggregate shocks in discrete time. Our approach relies on the rapid computation of \n            <jats:italic>sequence\u2010space Jacobians</jats:italic>\u2014the derivatives of perfect\u2010foresight equilibrium mappings between aggregate sequences around the steady state. Our main contribution is a fast algorithm for calculating Jacobians for a large class of heterogeneous\u2010agent problems. We combine this algorithm with a systematic approach to composing and inverting Jacobians to solve for general equilibrium impulse responses. We obtain a rapid procedure for likelihood\u2010based estimation and computation of nonlinear perfect\u2010foresight transitions. We apply our methods to three canonical heterogeneous\u2010agent models: a neoclassical model, a New Keynesian model with one asset, and a New Keynesian model with two assets.\n          </jats:p>",
