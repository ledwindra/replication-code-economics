    "abstract": "<jats:p>We propose a way to formalize the relationship between descriptive analysis and structural estimation. A researcher reports an estimate \n            <jats:italic>\u0109</jats:italic> of a structural quantity of interest \n            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> that is exactly or asymptotically unbiased under some base model. The researcher also reports descriptive statistics \n            <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\">\n              <mover accent=\"true\">\n                <mi>\u03b3</mi>\n                <mo>\u02c6</mo>\n              </mover>\n            </math> that estimate features \n            <jats:italic>\u03b3</jats:italic> of the distribution of the data that are related to \n            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> under the base model. A reader entertains a less restrictive model that is local to the base model, under which the estimate \n            <jats:italic>\u0109</jats:italic> may be biased. We study the reduction in worst\u2010case bias from a restriction that requires the reader's model to respect the relationship between \n            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> and \n            <jats:italic>\u03b3</jats:italic> specified by the base model. Our main result shows that the proportional reduction in worst\u2010case bias depends only on a quantity we call the \n            <jats:italic>informativeness</jats:italic> of \n            <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\">\n              <mover accent=\"true\">\n                <mi>\u03b3</mi>\n                <mo>\u02c6</mo>\n              </mover>\n            </math> for \n            <jats:italic>\u0109</jats:italic>. Informativeness can be easily estimated even for complex models. We recommend that researchers report estimated informativeness alongside their descriptive analyses, and we illustrate with applications to three recent papers.\n          </jats:p>",
