    "abstract": "<jats:p>A sender persuades a receiver to accept a project by disclosing information about a payoff\u2010relevant quality. The receiver has private information about the quality, referred to as his type. We show that the sender\u2010optimal mechanism takes the form of nested intervals: each type accepts on an interval of qualities and a more optimistic type's interval contains a less optimistic type's interval. This nested\u2010interval structure offers a simple algorithm to solve for the optimal disclosure and connects our problem to the monopoly screening problem. The mechanism is optimal even if the sender conditions the disclosure mechanism on the receiver's reported type.</jats:p>",
