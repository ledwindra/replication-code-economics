    "abstract": "<jats:p>We model the term structure of interest rates that results from the interaction between investors with preferences for specific maturities and risk\u2010averse arbitrageurs. Shocks to the short rate are transmitted to long rates through arbitrageurs' carry trades. Arbitrageurs earn rents from transmitting the shocks through bond risk premia that relate positively to the slope of the term structure. When the short rate is the only risk factor, changes in investor demand have the same relative effect on interest rates across maturities regardless of the maturities where they originate. When investor demand is also stochastic, demand effects become more localized. A calibration indicates that long rates underreact to forward\u2010guidance announcements about short rates. Large\u2010scale asset purchases can be more effective in moving long rates, especially if they are concentrated at long maturities.</jats:p>",
