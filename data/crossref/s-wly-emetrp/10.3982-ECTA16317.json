    "abstract": "<jats:p>We present a new multi\u2010sector growth model that features nonhomothetic, constant elasticity of substitution preferences, and accommodates long\u2010run demand and supply drivers of structural change for an arbitrary number of sectors. The model is consistent with the decline in agriculture, the hump\u2010shaped evolution of manufacturing, and the rise of services over time. We estimate the demand system derived from the model using household\u2010level data from the United States and India, as well as historical aggregate\u2010level panel data for 39 countries during the postwar period. The estimated model parsimoniously accounts for the broad patterns of sectoral reallocation observed among rich, miracle, and developing economies. Our estimates support the presence of strong nonhomotheticity across time, income levels, and countries. We find that income effects account for the bulk of the within\u2010country evolution of sectoral reallocation.</jats:p>",
