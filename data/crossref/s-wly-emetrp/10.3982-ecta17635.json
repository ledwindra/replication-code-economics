    "abstract": "<jats:p>More than two decades ago, a well\u2010known study on heart attack treatments provided evidence suggesting that, when appropriately adjusted for quality, medical care prices were actually declining (Cutler, McClellan, Newhouse, and Remler (1998)). Our paper revisits this subject by leveraging estimates from more than 8000 cost\u2010effectiveness studies across a broad range of conditions and treatments. We find large quality\u2010adjusted price declines associated with treatment innovations. To incorporate these quality\u2010adjusted indexes into an aggregate measure of inflation, we combine an unadjusted medical\u2010care price index, quality\u2010adjusted price indexes from treatment innovations, and proxies for the diffusion rate of new technologies. In contrast to official statistics that suggest medical care prices increased by 0.53 percent per year relative to economy\u2010wide inflation from 2000 to 2017, we find that quality\u2010adjusted medical care prices declined by 1.33 percent per year over the same period.</jats:p>",
