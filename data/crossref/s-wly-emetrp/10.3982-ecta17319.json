    "abstract": "<jats:p>We formulate a generalization of the traditional medium\u2010of\u2010exchange function of money in contexts where there is imperfect competition in the intermediation of credit, settlement, or payment services used to conduct transactions. We find that the option to settle transactions with money strengthens the stance of sellers of goods and services in relation to intermediaries, and show this mechanism is operative even for sellers who never exercise the option to sell for money. These \n            <jats:italic>latent</jats:italic> money demand considerations imply that in general, in contrast to current conventional wisdom in policy\u2010oriented research in monetary economics, monetary policy can remain effective through medium\u2010of\u2010exchange transmission channels\u2014even in highly developed credit economies where the share of monetary transactions is negligible.\n          </jats:p>",
