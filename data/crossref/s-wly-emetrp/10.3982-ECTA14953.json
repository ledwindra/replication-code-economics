For two popular functional forms of payoffs, we derive analytically tractable approximations for agent \n            <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>'s demand for \n            <jats:italic>\u03b8</jats:italic>. In an application where the \n            <jats:italic>\u03b8i</jats:italic>'s are purchased on a competitive market, we provide conditions for a competitive equilibrium to feature maximal information transmission. In a principal\u2013agent application where the agent's \n            <jats:italic>\u03b8</jats:italic> is set by the principal, our results show that information transmission will be partial. We consider extensions where: (1) the \n            <jats:italic>\u03b8</jats:italic>'s are acquired covertly rather than overtly and (2) the \n            <jats:italic>\u03b8</jats:italic>'s are traded \n            <jats:italic>after</jats:italic> the sender has received the information.\n          </jats:p>",
