    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper shows that robust inference under weak identification is important to the evaluation of many influential macro asset pricing models, including (time\u2010varying) rare\u2010disaster risk models and long\u2010run risk models. Building on recent developments in the conditional inference literature, we provide a novel conditional specification test by simulating the critical value conditional on a sufficient statistic. This sufficient statistic can be intuitively interpreted as a measure capturing the macroeconomic information decoupled from the underlying content of asset pricing theories. Macro\u2010finance decoupling is an effective way to improve the power of the specification test when asset pricing theories are difficult to refute because of a severe imbalance in the information content about the key model parameters between macroeconomic moment restrictions and asset pricing cross\u2010equation restrictions. We apply the proposed conditional specification test to the evaluation of a time\u2010varying rare\u2010disaster risk model and the construction of robust model uncertainty sets.</jats:p>",
