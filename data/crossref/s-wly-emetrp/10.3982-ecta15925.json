Suppose the auctioneer can deviate from the rules provided that no single bidder detects the deviation. A mechanism is<jats:italic>credible</jats:italic>if it is incentive\u2010compatible for the auctioneer to follow the rules. We study the optimal auctions in which only winners pay, under symmetric independent private values. The first\u2010price auction is the unique credible static mechanism. The ascending auction is the unique credible strategy\u2010proof mechanism.</jats:p>",
