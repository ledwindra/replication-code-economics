    "abstract": "<jats:p>The presence of a westward\u2010moving frontier of settlement shaped early U.S. history. In 1893, the historian Frederick Jackson Turner famously argued that the American frontier fostered individualism. We investigate the \u201cfrontier thesis\u201d and identify its long\u2010run implications for culture and politics. We track the frontier throughout the 1790\u20131890 period and construct a novel, county\u2010level measure of total frontier experience (TFE). Historically, frontier locations had distinctive demographics and greater individualism. Long after the closing of the frontier, counties with greater TFE exhibit more pervasive individualism and opposition to redistribution. This pattern cuts across known divides in the United States, including urban\u2013rural and north\u2013south. We provide evidence on the roots of frontier culture, identifying both selective migration and a causal effect of frontier exposure on individualism. Overall, our findings shed new light on the frontier's persistent legacy of rugged individualism.</jats:p>",
