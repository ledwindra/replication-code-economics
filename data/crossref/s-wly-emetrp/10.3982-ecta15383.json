    "abstract": "<jats:p>We propose a bootstrap procedure for data that may exhibit cluster\u2010dependence in two or more dimensions. The asymptotic distribution of the sample mean or other statistics may be non\u2010Gaussian if observations are dependent but uncorrelated within clusters. We show that there exists no procedure for estimating the limiting distribution of the sample mean under two\u2010way clustering that achieves uniform consistency. However, we propose bootstrap procedures that achieve adaptivity with respect to different uniformity criteria. Important cases and extensions discussed in the paper include regression inference, U\u2010 and V\u2010statistics, subgraph counts for network data, and non\u2010exhaustive samples of matched data.</jats:p>",
