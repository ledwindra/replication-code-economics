    "abstract": "<jats:p>We conduct inference on volatility with noisy high\u2010frequency data. We assume the observed transaction price follows a continuous\u2010time It\u00f4\u2010semimartingale, contaminated by a discrete\u2010time moving\u2010average noise process associated with the arrival of trades. We estimate volatility, defined as the quadratic variation of the semimartingale, by maximizing the likelihood of a misspecified moving\u2010average model, with its order selected based on an information criterion. Our inference is uniformly valid over a large class of noise processes whose magnitude and dependence structure vary with sample size. We show that the convergence rate of our estimator dominates \n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sup>1/4</jats:sup> as noise vanishes, and is determined by the selected order of noise dependence when noise is sufficiently small. Our implementation guarantees positive estimates in finite samples.\n          </jats:p>",
