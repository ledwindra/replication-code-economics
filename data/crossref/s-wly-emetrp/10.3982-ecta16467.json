    "abstract": "<jats:p>Present bias is the inclination to prefer a smaller present reward to a larger later reward, but reversing this preference when both rewards are equally delayed. Such behavior violates stationarity of temporal choices, and hence exponential discounting. This paper provides a weakening of the stationarity axiom that can accommodate present\u2010biased choice reversals. We call this new behavioral postulate \n            <jats:italic>Weak Present Bias</jats:italic> and characterize the general class of utility functions that is consistent with it. We show that present\u2010biased preferences can be represented as those of a decision maker who makes her choices according to conservative present\u2010equivalents, in the face of uncertainty about future tastes.\n          </jats:p>",
