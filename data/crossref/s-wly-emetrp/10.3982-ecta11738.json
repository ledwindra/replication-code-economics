    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper shows that the products and prices offered in markets are correlated with local income\u2010specific tastes. To quantify the welfare impact of this variation, I calculate local price indexes micro\u2010founded by a model of non\u2010homothetic demand over thousands of grocery products. These indexes reveal large differences in how wealthy and poor households perceive the choice sets available in wealthy and poor cities. Relative to low\u2010income households, high\u2010income households enjoy 40 percent higher utility per dollar expenditure in wealthy cities, relative to poor cities. Similar patterns are observed across stores in different neighborhoods. Most of this variation is explained by differences in the product assortment offered, rather than the relative prices charged, by chains that operate in different markets.</jats:p>",
