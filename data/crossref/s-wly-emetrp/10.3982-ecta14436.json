    "abstract": "<jats:p>Insurgency and guerrilla warfare impose enormous socio\u2010economic costs and often persist for decades. The opacity of such forms of conflict is an obstacle to effective international humanitarian intervention and development programs. To shed light on the internal organization of otherwise unknown insurgent groups, this paper proposes two methodologies for the detection of unobserved coalitions of militants in conflict areas. These approaches are based on daily geocoded incident\u2010level data on insurgent attacks. We provide applications to the Afghan conflict during the 2004\u20132009 period and to Pakistan during the 2008\u20132011 period, identifying systematically different coalition structures. Applications to global terrorism data and identification of new groups or shifting coalitions are discussed.</jats:p>",
