    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we study how occupation (or industry) tradability shapes local labor\u2010market adjustment to immigration. Theoretically, we derive a simple condition under which the arrival of foreign\u2010born labor into a region crowds native\u2010born workers out of (or into) immigrant\u2010intensive jobs, thus lowering (or raising) relative wages in these occupations, and we explain why this process differs within tradable versus within nontradable activities. Using data for U.S. commuting zones over the period 1980\u20132012, we find\u2014consistent with our theory\u2014that a local influx of immigrants crowds out employment of native\u2010born workers in more relative to less immigrant\u2010intensive nontradable jobs, but has no such effect across tradable occupations. Further analysis of occupation labor payments is consistent with adjustment to immigration within tradables occurring more through changes in output (versus changes in prices) when compared to adjustment within nontradables, thereby confirming our model's theoretical mechanism. We then use the model to explore the quantitative consequences of counterfactual changes in U.S. immigration on real wages at the occupation and region level.</jats:p>",
