    "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> The objective of this article is to open a dialogue on integrating service\u2010learning into community based watershed management programs and to discuss opportunities and challenges that a service\u2010learning program presents to universities and communities. The article presents the concept and definition of service\u2010learning, and arguments concerning why institutions of higher education and university faculty and students should be involved with community based watershed management programs. The article describes a case study for developing a service\u2010learning program for watershed management at Virginia Tech and discusses lessons learned from the case study. The paper concluded that to make a service\u2010learning program sustainable, there should be a long term plan, regular and effective communication with the stakeholders, and some incentives for faculty and students for long term commitment to the community based watershed management programs.</jats:p>",
