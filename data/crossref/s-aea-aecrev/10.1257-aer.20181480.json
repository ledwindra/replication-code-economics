    "abstract": "<jats:p> We use a novel experimental design to reliably elicit subjects\u2019 strategies in an infinitely repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma experiment with perfect monitoring. We find that three simple strategies repre\u2011 sent the majority of the chosen strategies: Always Defect, Tit\u2011for\u2011Tat, and Grim. In addition, we identify how the strategies systematically vary with the parameters of the game. Finally, we use the elicited strategies to test the ability to recover strategies using statistical methods based on observed round\u2011by\u2011round cooperation choices and find that this can be done fairly well, but only under certain conditions.
