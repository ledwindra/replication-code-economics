    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using confidential establishment-level data from the US Census Bureau\u2019s Longitudinal Business Database, this paper documents how local shocks propagate across US regions through firms\u2019 internal networks of establishments. Consistent with a model of optimal within-firm resource allocation, we find that establishment-level employment is sensitive to shocks in distant regions in which the establishment\u2019s parent firm is operating, and that the elasticity with respect to such shocks increases with the firm\u2019s financial constraint. At the aggregate regional level, we find that aggregate county-level employment is sensitive to shocks in distant counties linked through firms\u2019 internal networks.
