    "abstract": "<jats:p> We study choice over prescription insurance plans by the elderly using government administrative data to evaluate how these choices evolve over time. We find large \u201cforegone savings\u201d from not choosing the lowest cost plan that has grown over time. We develop a structural framework to decompose the changes in \u201cforegone welfare\u201d from inconsistent choices into choice set changes and choice function changes from a fixed choice set. We find that foregone welfare increases over time due primarily to changes in plan characteristics such as premiums and out-of-pocket costs; we estimate little learning at either the individual or cohort level.
