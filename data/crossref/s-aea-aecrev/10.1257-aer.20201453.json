    "abstract": "<jats:p> Health insurers increasingly compete on their networks of medical providers. Using data from Massachusetts\u2019s insurance exchange, I find substantial adverse selection against plans covering the most prestigious and expensive \u201cstar\u201d hospitals. I highlight a theoretically distinct selection channel: consumers loyal to star hospitals incur high spending, conditional on their medical state, because they use these hospitals\u2019 expensive care. This implies heterogeneity in consumers\u2019 incremental costs of gaining access to star hospitals, posing a challenge for standard selection policies. Along with selection on unobserved sickness, I find this creates strong incentives to exclude star hospitals, even with risk adjustment in place. (JEL D82, G22, H75, I11, I13, I18) </jats:p>",
