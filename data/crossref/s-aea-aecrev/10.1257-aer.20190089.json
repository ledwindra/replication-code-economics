    "abstract": "<jats:p> Lemoine and Rudik (2017) argues that it is efficient to delay reducing carbon emissions, due to supposed inertia in the climate system\u2019s response to emissions. This conclusion rests upon misunderstanding the relevant earth system modeling: there is no substantial lag between CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions and warming. Applying a representation of the earth system that captures the range of responses seen in complex earth system models invalidates the original article\u2019s implications for climate policy. The least-cost policy path that limits warming to 2\u00b0C implies that the carbon price starts high and increases at the interest rate. It cannot rely on climate inertia to delay reducing and allow greater cumulative emissions. (JEL H23, Q54, Q58) </jats:p>",
