    "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze how separations responded to arbitrary differences in own and peer wages at a large US retailer. Regression-discontinuity estimates imply large causal effects of own-wages on separations, and on quits in particular. However, this own-wage response could reflect comparisons either to market wages or to peer wages. Estimates using peer-wage discontinuities show large peer-wage effects and imply the own-wage separation response mostly reflects peer comparisons. The peer effect is driven by comparisons with higher-paid peers\u2014suggesting concerns about fairness. Separations appear fairly insensitive when raises are similar across peers\u2014suggesting search frictions and monopsony are relevant in this low-wage sector.
