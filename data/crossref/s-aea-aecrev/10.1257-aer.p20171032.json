    "abstract": "<jats:p> Economics journals with reproducibility policies are cited more often than others. For the minority of journals with a mandatory and enforced policy, this is significant when controlling for time and journal effects. To cope with the large variety of software used and to develop standards for replicability, joint efforts of journals could ensure each empirical study is published with data, code, and instructions on how to use them together. Individual reviewers could take initiative by asking for replicable empirical results. The American Journal of Political Science sets an example by having all empirical studies externally check for replicability prior to publication. </jats:p>",
