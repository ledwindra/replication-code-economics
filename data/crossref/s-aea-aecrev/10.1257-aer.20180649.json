    "abstract": "<jats:p> The homes of firm owners are an important source of finance for ongoing businesses. We use UK microdata to show that a \u00a31 increase in the value of the homes of a firm\u2019s directors increases the firm\u2019s investment by \u00a30.03. This effect is concentrated among firms whose directors\u2019 homes are valuable relative to the firm\u2019s assets, that are financially constrained, and that have directors who are personally highly levered. An aggregation exercise shows that directors\u2019 homes are as important as corporate property for collateral driven fluctuations in aggregate investment demand.
