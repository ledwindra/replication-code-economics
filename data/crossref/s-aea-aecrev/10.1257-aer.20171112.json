    "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the impact of a personalized technology-aided after-school instruction program in middle-school grades in urban India using a lottery that provided winners with free access to the program. Lottery winners scored 0.37 \u03c3 higher in math and 0.23 \u03c3 higher in Hindi over just a 4.5-month period. IV estimates suggest that attending the program for 90 days would increase math and Hindi test scores by 0.6 \u03c3 and 0.39 \u03c3 respectively. We find similar absolute test score gains for all students, but much greater relative gains for academically-weaker students. Our results suggest that well-designed, technology-aided instruction programs can sharply improve productivity in delivering education. (JEL I21, I26, I28, J24, O15) </jats:p>",
