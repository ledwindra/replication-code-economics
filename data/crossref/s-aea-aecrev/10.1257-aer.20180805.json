    "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine whether shared collective experiences help build a national identity, by looking at the impact of national football teams\u2019 victories in sub-Saharan Africa. We find that individuals surveyed in the days after an important victory of their country\u2019s national team are 37 percent less likely to identify primarily with their ethnic group, and 30 percent more likely to trust other ethnicities, than those interviewed just before. Crucially, national team achievements also reduce violence: countries that (barely) qualified to the Africa Cup of Nations experience less civil conflict (9 percent fewer episodes) in the following months than countries that (barely) did not.
