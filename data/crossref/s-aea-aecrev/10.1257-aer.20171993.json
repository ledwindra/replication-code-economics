    "abstract": "<jats:p> We study how health behaviors are shaped through family spillovers. We leverage administrative data to identify the effects of health shocks on family members\u2019 consumption of preventive care and health-related behaviors, constructing counterfactuals for affected households using households that experience the same shock but a few years in the future. Spouses and adult children immediately improve their health behaviors and their responses are both significant and persistent. These spillovers are far-reaching as they cascade even to coworkers. While some responses are consistent with learning information about one\u2019s own health, the evidence points to salience as a major operative explanation. (JEL D15, D83, I12, J12) </jats:p>",
