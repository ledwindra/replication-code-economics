    "abstract": "<jats:p> Studying job matching in a Kelso-Crawford framework, we consider arbitrary constraints imposed on sets of doctors that a hospital can hire. We characterize all constraints that preserve the substitutes condition (for all revenue functions that satisfy the substitutes condition), a critical condition on hospitals\u2019 revenue functions for well-behaved competitive equilibria. A constraint preserves the substitutes condition if and only if it is a \u201cgeneralized interval constraint,\u201d which specifies the minimum and maximum numbers of hired doctors, forces some hires, and forbids others. Additionally, \u201cgeneralized polyhedral constraints\u201d are precisely those that preserve the substitutes condition for all \u201cgroup separable\u201d revenue functions.
