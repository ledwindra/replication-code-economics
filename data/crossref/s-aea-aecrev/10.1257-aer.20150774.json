    "abstract": "<jats:p> We combine georeferenced data on mining extraction of 14 minerals with information on conflict events at spatial resolution of 0.5 <jats:sup>o </jats:sup> \u00d7 0.5 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup> for all of Africa between 1997 and 2010. Exploiting exogenous variations in world prices, we find a positive impact of mining on conflict at the local level. Quantitatively, our estimates suggest that the historical rise in mineral prices (commodity super-cycle) might explain up to one-fourth of the average level of violence across African countries over the period. We then document how a fighting group's control of a mining area contributes to escalation from local to global violence. Finally, we analyze the impact of corporate practices and transparency initiatives in the mining industry. (JEL C23, D74, L70, O13, Q34) </jats:p>",
