    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an earlier work (Kamada and Kojima 2015), we introduced \u201cmatching with constraints,\u201d a two-sided matching problem in which the market is subject to feasibility constraints. That paper proposed and analyzed a possible solution to this problem and discussed various real-market applications of our results. The present paper reorganizes some of the findings from our more recent effort, based on Kamada and Kojima (2016a, b). </jats:p>",
