    "abstract": "<jats:p> We propose a measure of systemic risk, \u0394 CoVaR, defined as the change in the value at risk of the financial system conditional on an institution being under distress relative to its median state. Our estimates show that characteristics such as leverage, size, maturity mismatch, and asset price booms significantly predict \u0394 CoVaR. We also provide out-of-sample forecasts of a countercyclical, forward-looking measure of systemic risk, and show that the 2006:IV value of this measure would have predicted more than one-third of realized \u0394 CoVaR during the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis.
