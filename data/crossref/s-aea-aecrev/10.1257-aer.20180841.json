    "abstract": "<jats:p> We study how sharing a hometown or college connection with an incumbent member of China\u2019s Politburo affects a candidate\u2019s likelihood of selection as a new member. In specifications that include fixed effects to absorb quality differences across cities and colleges, we find that hometown and college connections are each associated with 5\u20139 percentage point reductions in selection probability. This \u201cconnections penalty\u201d is equally strong for retiring Politburo members, arguing against quota-based explanations, and it is much stronger for junior Politburo members, consistent with a role for intra-factional competition. Our findings differ from earlier work because of our emphasis on within-group variation, and our focus on shared hometown and college, rather than shared workplace, connections.
