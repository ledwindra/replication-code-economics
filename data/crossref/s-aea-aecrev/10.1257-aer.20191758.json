    "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a Chinese policy that awards substantial tax cuts to firms with R&amp;D investment over a threshold or \u201cnotch.\u201d Quasi-experimental variation and administrative tax data show a significant increase in reported R&amp;D that is partly driven by firms relabeling expenses as R&amp;D. Structural estimates show relabeling accounts for 24.2 percent of reported R&amp;D and that doubling R&amp;D would increase productivity by 9 percent. Policy simulations show that firm selection and relabeling determine the cost-effectiveness of stimulating R&amp;D, that notch-based policies are more effective than tax credits when relabeling is prevalent, and that modest spillovers justify the program from a welfare perspective.
