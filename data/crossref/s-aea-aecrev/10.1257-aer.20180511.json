    "abstract": "<jats:p> We evaluate the medium-term impacts of treating maternal depression on women\u2019s mental health, financial empowerment, and parenting decisions. We leverage variation induced by a cluster-randomized controlled trial that provided psychotherapy to 903 prenatally depressed mothers in rural Pakistan. It was one of the world\u2019s largest psych otherapy interventions, and it dramatically reduced postpartum depression. Seven years after psychotherapy concluded, we returned to the study site to find that impacts on women\u2019s mental health had persisted, with a 17 percent reduction in depression rates. The intervention also improved women\u2019s financial empowerment and increased both time- and money-intensive parental investments by between 0.2 and 0.3 standard deviations.
