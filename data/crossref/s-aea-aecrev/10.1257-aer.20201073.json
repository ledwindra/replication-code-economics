    "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the welfare effects of offering choice over coverage levels\u2014\u201cvertical choice\u201d\u2014in regulated health insurance markets. We emphasize that heterogeneity in efficient coverage level is not sufficient to motivate choice. When premiums cannot reflect individuals\u2019 costs, it may not be in consumers\u2019 best interest to select their efficient coverage level. We show that vertical choice is efficient only if consumers with higher willingness to pay have a higher efficient level of coverage. We investigate this condition empirically and find that as long as a minimum coverage level can be enforced, the welfare gains from vertical choice are either zero or economically small.
