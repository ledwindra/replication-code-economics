    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper provides a snapshot of undergraduate research at top 30 liberal arts institutions and top 30 national universities (based on U.S. News and World Report rankings, 2017). This description provides a broader perspective than exists in the literature as we identify departmental motivations for providing undergraduate research opportunities despite the lack of mandates. We also document the extent to which a variety of forms of undergraduate research occur (programmatically and by student numbers). Also included are descriptions of innovative approaches to promoting undergraduate research in light of constraints and methods for creating a culture conducive to undergraduate research. </jats:p>",
