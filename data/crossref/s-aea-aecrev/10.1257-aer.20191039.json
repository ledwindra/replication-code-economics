    "abstract": "<jats:p> We study experimentally when, why, and how people intervene in others\u2019 choices. Choice Architects (CAs) construct opportunity sets containing bundles of time-indexed payments for Choosers. CAs frequently prevent impatient choices despite opportunities to provide advice, believing Choosers benefit. They violate common behavioral welfare criteria by removing impatient options even when all payoffs are delayed. CAs intervene not by removing options they wish they could resist when choosing for themselves (mistakes-projective paternalism), but rather as if they seek to align others\u2019 choices with their own aspirations (ideals-projective paternalism). Laboratory choices predict subjects\u2019 support for actual paternalistic policies. (JEL C92, D12, D15) </jats:p>",
