    "abstract": "<jats:p> Intermittent monitoring of environmental standards may induce strategic changes in polluting activities. This paper documents local strategic responses to a cyclical, once-every-six-day air quality monitoring schedule under the federal Clean Air Act. Using satellite data of monitored areas, I show that air quality is significantly worse on unmonitored days. This effect is explained by short-term suppression of pollution on monitored days, especially during high-pollution periods when the city\u2019s noncompliance risk is high. Cities\u2019 use of air quality warnings increases on monitored days, which suggests local governments\u2019 role in coordinating emission reductions. (JEL K32, Q35, Q58, R11) </jats:p>",
