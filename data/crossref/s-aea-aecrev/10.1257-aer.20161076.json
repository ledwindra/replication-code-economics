    "abstract": "<jats:p> Households with familiarity biases tilt their portfolios toward a few risky assets. The resulting mean-variance loss from portfolio underdiversification is equivalent to only a modest reduction of about 1\u00a0 percent per year in a household\u2019s portfolio return. However, once we consider also the effect of familiarity biases on the asset- allocation and intertemporal consumption-savings decisions, the welfare loss is multiplied by a factor of four. In\u00a0 general equilibrium, the suboptimal decisions of households distort also aggregate growth, amplifying further the overall social welfare loss. Our findings demonstrate that financial markets are not a mere sideshow to the real economy and that improving the financial decisions of households can lead to large benefits, not just for individual households, but also for society.
