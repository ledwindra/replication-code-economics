    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2013 Memphis City Schools and Shelby County Schools consolidated into a unified system, creating one of the largest districts in the nation. Six Memphis suburbs subsequently voted to create separate municipal districts. Many school zoning changes resulted from the merger and subsequent splintering of districts, providing a rare opportunity to separately identify the value of both school and district quality as they are capitalized in housing prices. Utilizing school fixed effects and repeat sales data, we find that a one standard deviation increase in test scores increases prices by 3-4% while district administration accounts for 5-8% of home values. </jats:p>",
