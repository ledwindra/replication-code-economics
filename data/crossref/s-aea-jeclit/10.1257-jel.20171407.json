    "abstract": "<jats:p> I review William N. Goetzmann\u2019s Money Changes Everything: How Finance Made Civilization Possible. This magnificent book offers insightful coverage of more than 5,000 years of human history under the theme of \u201chow finance made civilization possible.\u201d I reinterpret its main hypotheses in the context of recent economic research on finance and development, and also compare them with other economic historians\u2019 views. I suggest that further examinations of the historical facts in the book could guide us in rethinking financial regulation. ( JEL E42, E44, G00, N20) </jats:p>",
