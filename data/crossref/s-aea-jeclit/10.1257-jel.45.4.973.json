    "abstract": "<jats:p> Freakonomics is more about \u201centertainment\u201d than it is a serious attempt at popularization. Consequently, rather than conduct a comprehensive fact check, I use the book as a springboard for a broader inquiry into social science research and take issue with the book's surprising premise that \u201cEconomics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions.\u201d Using examples from Freakonomics, I argue that some of the questions the book addresses are \u201cuninteresting\u201d because it is impossible to even imagine what a good answer would look like. I conclude with some thoughts about the role of economic theory in generating interesting questions and/or answers. </jats:p>",
