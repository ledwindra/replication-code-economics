    "abstract": "<jats:p> I review The End of Alchemy by Mervyn King, published by W. W. Norton and Company in 2016. I discuss King\u2019s proposed regulatory reform, the \u201cpawnbroker for all seasons\u201d (PFAS), and I compare it to an alternative solution developed in my own work. I argue that unregulated trade in the financial markets will not, in general, lead to Pareto-optimal allocations. As a consequence, solutions like the PFAS that correct problems with existing institutions are likely to be circumvented by the development of new ones.
