    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay reviews Till Time\u2019s Last Sand: A History of the Bank of England, 1694\u20132013, David Kynaston\u2019s history of the Bank of England (the Bank) from its foundation in 1694 to the present day. I focus on three themes running through his narrative. First, for much of that time, the Bank was a private company playing a public role; how did it manage to do this and why was it eventually brought into public ownership? Second, I examine the various attempts to constrain the Bank\u2019s monetary policy to follow a simple rule; these almost invariably proved unsustainable unless the rule provided enough room for discretion. Finally, I cover the Bank\u2019s journey to becoming the lender of last resort, together with its evolving attitude to the associated risk of moral hazard.
