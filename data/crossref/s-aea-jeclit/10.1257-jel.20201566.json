    "abstract": "<jats:p> Anders \u00c5slund provides a comprehensive description of the main political and economic events of Vladimir Putin\u2019s 20 years at the helm of the country. In politics, \u00c5slund shows how Putin skillfully maneuvered to destroy democracy in Russia. I argue that the \u201ccultural backlash\u201d by older generations played perhaps an even more important role. I also show that the young generations hold rather liberal values, thus providing hope for the future. In economics, \u00c5slund focuses on large state corporations, assets of Putin\u2019s cronies, and macroeconomic policies, with only general statements about the country\u2019s institutional weakness. I complement \u00c5slund\u2019s analysis by a more detailed examination of the impact of institutions and briefly survey fiscal federalism and informal economic activities\u2014issues without which the workings of the Russian economy are hard to understand.
