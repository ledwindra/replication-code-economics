    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) regularly reviews books of interest to the economics profession. The Economic Report of the President (ERP) falls under that purview and beginning this year, the JEL will be reviewing the ERP. Toward that end, I have asked a handful of very prominent economists to review the 2005 ERP. Reviewers were chosen to reflect expertise on what I guessed would be key issues. Reviewers were given the following instructions: </jats:p><jats:p> The ERP in principle should provide an accurate assessment of the consensus professional views of economists on any given issue, based on the research to date. Does the discussion in the ERP in fact accurately summarize what we as economists know? </jats:p><jats:p> Reviewers were given free rein over what material they would review in the ERP but were urged to focus on their areas of particular expertise. </jats:p><jats:p> In the reviews that follow, Joel Slemrod reviews the discussion of tax reform. Joe Farrell reviews the ERP's chapter titled \u201cInnovation and the Information Economy.\u201d Gordon Hanson reviews the chapters on international trade and on immigration. Robert Hall reviews the discussion of the adverse macroeconomic impact of rising oil prices while Jonathan Gruber reviews the ERP chapter titled \u201cExpanding Individual Choice and Control.\u201d </jats:p><jats:p> Many thanks to the reviewers for the quick turnaround. </jats:p>",
