    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article provides guidance on how to evaluate and improve the forecasting ability of models in the presence of instabilities, which are widespread in economic time series. Empirically relevant examples include predicting the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, as well as, more broadly, fluctuations in asset prices, exchange rates, output growth, and inflation. In the context of unstable environments, I discuss how to assess models\u2019 forecasting ability; how to robustify models\u2019 estimation; and how to correctly report measures of forecast uncertainty. Importantly, and perhaps surprisingly, breaks in models\u2019 parameters are neither necessary nor sufficient to generate time variation in models\u2019 forecasting performance: thus, one should not test for breaks in models\u2019 parameters, but rather evaluate their forecasting ability in a robust way. In addition, local measures of models\u2019 forecasting performance are more appropriate than traditional, average measures. (JEL C51, C53, E31, E32, E37, F37) </jats:p>",
