    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay reviews Networks and Markets, edited by James E. Rauch and Alessandra Casella. This book provides a useful vehicle for clarifying the main conceptual and operational issues facing the growing study of economic networks. Three types of networks are discussed: networks as concentrated or patterned exchange; as primordial relations; and, the most general, networks as structures of mutual orientation. An overview is provided of the challenges faced by research on the economic implications of three types of networks. The strengths and weaknesses of current research on economic networks are examined via a review of the contributions in the book. </jats:p>",
