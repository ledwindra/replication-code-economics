    "abstract": "<jats:p> Investors hold a substantially larger proportion of their wealth portfolios in domestic assets than standard portfolio theory would suggest, a phenomenon called \u201cequity home bias.\u201d In the absence of this bias, investors would optimally diversify domestic output risk using foreign equities. Therefore, consumption growth rates would tend to co-move across countries even when output growth rates do not. Empirically, however, consumption growth rates tend to have a lower correlation across countries than do output growth rates, a phenomenon I call \u201cconsumption home bias.\u201d In this paper, I discuss these two biases and their potential relationship as suggested by the literature. </jats:p>",
