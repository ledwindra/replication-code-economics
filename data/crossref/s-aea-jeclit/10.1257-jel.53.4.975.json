    "abstract": "<jats:p> Timothy Geithner's memoir of the financial crisis of 2007\u201308\u2014Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises\u2014is an important historical document offering details of how policies were formed and implemented during the crisis, showing the political constraints, and offering lessons for future crises. Walter Bagehot's classic rule for fighting crises\u2014 that the central bank should lend against good collateral at a high rate\u2014is passive and incomplete. Geithner argues for the use of overwhelming force to reestablish confidence. Also, although the Federal Reserve's new crisis lending programs needed to be anonymous so as not to reveal weak banks' identities\u2014\u201cstigma\u201d\u2014the stress tests during the crisis did reveal information that may have been useful in reestablishing confidence.
