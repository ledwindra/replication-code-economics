How should welfare states be designed to enable countries to reap the benefits of globalization? These are the main themes of Hans-Werner Sinn's book, Can Germany Be Saved? We view Germany as a case study of how a welfare state can go wrong in reacting to the pressures of globalization. We present two views of globalization\u2014the \u201cspecialization view\u201d (of Sinn) and the \u201cGreat Reorganization view\u201d (ours)\u2014and examine the policy implications of each for the welfare state design. </jats:p>",
