    "abstract": "<jats:p> The twelve essays in this volume deal with the definition of meritocracy and equality of opportunity, the causes and consequences of intelligence, schooling and inequality, and equal-opportunity policy options. They emphasize the importance of education and race, relative to IQ. Collectively, they argue that it may be possible to both reduce inequality and improve efficiency by reducing the market imperfections that contribute to inequality. </jats:p>",
