    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reviews Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson\u2019s book The Narrow Corridor. They depict a constant tussle between \u201csociety,\u201d which wants liberty but cannot sustain order, and \u201cstate,\u201d which maintains order but grows oppressive. I argue that the book has a huge theme and an impressive historical sweep of supportive examples, but leaves many open questions. The two conceptual categories should be unpacked to examine complex interactions within and across them, and other examples that counter the authors\u2019 thesis should be reckoned with. However, the authors deserve congratulations for a brilliantly written and thought-provoking book that will inspire much future research. (JEL N10, O43, P51, Y30) </jats:p>",
