    "abstract": "<jats:p> William Easterly marshals yet another brilliant critique of established development policies, with a focus on the experts' excessive focus on state-led policies and goals (\u00e0 la Myrdal) and ignorance of bottom-up solutions, including technology and individual rights (\u00e0 la Hayek). It suggests a world where success occurs in spite of nation-states. Yet not all bottom-up leads to success, and the worst disasters, as in civil violence, occur where states fail. Easterly highlights the important links between success and individual freedom and opportunity. He fails to note that myriad impoverished individuals cannot exercise these freedoms due to low expectations or compromised rights. (JEL A11, D82, E61, I23, O10, O40) </jats:p>",
