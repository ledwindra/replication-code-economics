    "abstract": "<jats:p> Taylor (2019) details heterogeneity in the effects of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) across industries and across time. Through first the President\u2019s Reemployment Act (PRA) and then industry-specific \u201ccodes of fair competition,\u201d the NIRA raised wages and restricted working hours. In some\u2014but far from all\u2014cases industries also used a NIRA code to collude, raising prices and restricting output. The effect of the NIRA peaked in fall 1933 and winter 1934; thereafter, compliance declined. I review the intellectual history of the NIRA, the implementation of the PRA and the NIRA codes, and Taylor\u2019s econometric evidence on their effects. I end with a discussion of the implications of Taylor\u2019s book for understanding the effect of the NIRA on US recovery from the Great Depression. (JEL D72, G01, H50, N32, N42) </jats:p>",
