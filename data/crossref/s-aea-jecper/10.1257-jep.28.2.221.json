    "abstract": "<jats:p> Gremlins intervened in the preparation of my paper \u201cThe Economic Effects of Climate Change\u201d published in the Spring 2009 issue of this journal. In Table 1 of that paper, titled \u201cEstimates of the Welfare Impact of Climate Change,\u201d minus signs were dropped from the two impact estimates, one by Plambeck and Hope (1996) and one by Hope (2006). In Figure 1 of that paper, titled \u201cFourteen Estimates of the Global Economic Impact of Climate Change,\u201d and in the various analyses that support that figure, the minus sign was dropped from only one of the two estimates. The corresponding Table 1 and Figure 1 presented here correct these errors. Figure 2 titled, \u201cTwenty-One Estimates of the Global Economic Impact of Climate Change\u201d adds two overlooked estimates from before the time of the original 2009 paper and five more recent ones. </jats:p>",
