    "abstract": "<jats:p> Retired households, especially those with high lifetime income, decumulate their wealth very slowly, and many die leaving large estates. The three leading explanations for the \u201cretirement savings puzzle\u201d are the desire to insure against uncertain lifespans and medical expenses, the desire to leave bequests to one\u2019s heirs, and the desire to remain in one\u2019s own home. We discuss the empirical strategies used to differentiate these motivations, most of which go beyond wealth to exploit additional features of the data. The literature suggests that all the motivations are present, but has yet to reach a consensus about their relative importance. </jats:p>",
