    "abstract": "<jats:p> The near-failure on September 16, 2008, of American International Group (AIG) was an iconic moment in the financial crisis. Two large bets on real estate made with funding vulnerable to bank-run-like dynamics pushed AIG to the brink of bankruptcy. AIG used securities lending to transform insurance company assets into residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, ultimately losing at least $21 billion and threatening the solvency of the life insurance companies. AIG also sold insurance on multisector collateralized debt obligations, backed by real estate assets, ultimately losing more than $30 billion. These activities were apparently motivated by a belief that AIG's real estate bets would not suffer defaults and were \u201cmoney-good.\u201d We find that these securities have in fact suffered write-downs and that the stark \u201cmoney-good\u201d claim can be rejected. Ultimately, both liquidity and solvency were issues for AIG. </jats:p>",
