    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the publication of Keynes\u2019s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, generations of economists have been led to believe that Say was Keynes\u2019s ultimate nemesis. By means of textual and contextual analysis, we show that Keynes and Say held similar views on several key issues, such as the possibility of aggregate-demand deficiency, the role of money in the economy, and government intervention. Our conclusion is that there are enough similarities to call into question the idea that Keynes\u2019s views were antithetical to Say\u2019s. The irony is that Keynes was not aware of these similarities. Our study sheds new light on the interpretation of Keynes\u2019s work and on his criticism of classical political economy. Moreover, it suggests that some policy implications of demand-side and supply-side frameworks overlap. Finally, the study underlines the importance of a thorough analysis of the primary sources to fully grasp the substance of Say\u2019s message. </jats:p>",
