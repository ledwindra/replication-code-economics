    "abstract": "<jats:p> Does the World Bank still have an important role to play? How might it fulfill that role? The paper begins with a brief account of how the Bank works. It then argues that, while the Bank is no longer the primary conduit for capital from high-income to low-income countries, it still has an important role in supplying the public good of development knowledge\u2014a role that is no less pressing today than ever. This argument is not a new one. In 1996, the Bank\u2019s President at the time, James D. Wolfensohn, laid out a vision for the \u201cknowledge bank,\u201d an implicit counterpoint to what can be called the \u201clending bank.\u201d The paper argues that the past rhetoric of the \u201cknowledge bank\u201d has not matched the reality. An institution such as the World Bank\u2014explicitly committed to global poverty reduction\u2014should be more heavily invested in knowing what is needed in its client countries as well as in international coordination. It should be consistently arguing for well-informed pro-poor policies in its member countries, tailored to the needs of each country, even when such policies are unpopular with the powers-that-be. It should also be using its financial weight, combined with its analytic and convening powers, to support global public goods. In all this, there is a continuing role for lending, but it must be driven by knowledge\u2014both in terms of what gets done and how it is geared to learning. The paper argues that the Bank disappoints in these tasks but that it could perform better. </jats:p>",
