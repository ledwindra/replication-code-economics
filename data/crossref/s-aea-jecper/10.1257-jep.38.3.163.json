    "abstract": "<jats:p> Economics faces stubborn underrepresentation of minoritized identity groups. Economics instructors also largely use antiquated instructional methods. We leverage the literature from the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education, which have rigorously studied instructional techniques and gathered evidence on a variety of methods that improve learning and reduce demographic gaps. We discuss four broad ideas: active and collaborative learning, role model interventions, modernized design of assessments and feedback, and culturally relevant, responsive, and sustaining pedagogy. We frame these approaches in the context of economics identity, share evidence regarding efficacy, and give examples of how the techniques have been and can be used in economics. In so doing, we provide a set of changes economics instructors can make, large and small, to improve their teaching for all students and to reduce demographic gaps in success and persistence in the field. </jats:p>",
