    "abstract": "<jats:p> This symposium provides several examples of overconfidence in certain economic contexts. Michael Grubb looks at \u201cOverconfident Consumers in the Marketplace.\u201d Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate consider \u201cBehavioral CEOs: The Role of Managerial Overconfidence.\u201d Kent Daniel and David Hirshleifer discuss \u201cOverconfident Investors, Predictable Returns, and Excessive Trading.\u201d A number of insights and lessons emerge for our understanding of markets, public policy, and welfare. How do firms take advantage of consumer overconfidence? Might government attempts to rule out such practices end up providing benefits to some consumers but imposing costs on others? How are empirical measures of CEO overconfidence related to investment and the capital structure of firms? Can overconfidence among at least some investors help to explain prominent anomalies in stock markets like high levels of trading volume and certain predictable patterns in stock market returns? </jats:p>",
