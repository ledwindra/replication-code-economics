    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2023, the federal antitrust agencies rewrote the nation's flagship merger policy document, as part of a broader \u201cNeo-Brandeisian\u201d effort to bring about a deep reform of the antitrust system. The result\u2014the 2023 Merger Guidelines\u2014has been highly controversial: celebrated by some as a revolutionary advance, and criticized by others as a step back toward a benighted past. This article evaluates the 2023 guidance against the arc of antitrust's modern history. It argues that the new guidance breaks a long trend of migration from structure toward welfare as the primary orientation of merger enforcement, but that it does so cautiously, by achieving a fraught ambiguity between welfarist and nonwelfarist policies. In inviting both revolutionary and evolutionary readings, the agencies have sacrificed clarity and discouraged beneficial deals, but they have also deferred\u2014at least for now\u2014a sharp conflict between those who would preserve antitrust's governing paradigm and those who would remake it. </jats:p>",
