We find that program-evaluation randomized controlled trials published over the last 15 years have typically been \u201csmall\u201d in these senses, but also identify a number of examples\u2014including from our own work\u2014 demonstrating that experimentation at much larger scales is both feasible and valuable. </jats:p>",
