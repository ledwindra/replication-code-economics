    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many economists are accustomed to thinking about Federal Reserve policy in terms of the institution's \u201cdual mandate,\u201d which refers to price stability and high employment, and in which the exchange rate and other international variables matter only insofar as they influence inflation and the output gap\u2014which is to say, not very much. In fact, this conventional view is heavily shaped by the distinctive and peculiar circumstances of the last three decades, when the influence of international considerations on Fed policy has been limited. In fact, the Federal Reserve paid significant attention to international considerations in its first two decades, followed by relative inattention to such factors in the two-plus decades that followed, then back to renewed attention to international aspects of monetary policy in the 1960s, before the recent period of benign neglect of the international dimension. I argue that in the next few decades, international aspects are likely to play a larger role in Federal Reserve policy making than at present. </jats:p>",
