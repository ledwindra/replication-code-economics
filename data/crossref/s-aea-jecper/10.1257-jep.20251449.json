    "abstract": "<jats:p>The 1993 publication of a World Bank book on the East Asian Miracle explained the extraordinarily rapid growth of Japan and seven other economies of East Asia (at 5 percent a year) between 1965 and 1990 as grounded in those economies\u2019 adherence to market \u201cfundamentals\u201d\u2014sound macro management, \u201cshared\u201d growth policies, investment in human capital\u2014combined with an \u201cexport push\u201d which fostered the technological learning that drove those countries\u2019 high total factor productivity growth. The Bank authors dismissed \u201cindustrial policy\u201d as central to their growth and cautioned against other developing countries adopting industrial policy in the absence of strong government institutions. Was the book too much a product of its post-Soviet, neoliberal era? Considering what we know now about the state of governance in developing countries, might industrial policy help boost growth in at least some developing countries?</jats:p>",
