For example, the paper will consider the extent of diversity of organizational forms; whether organizations can easily shift their defining characteristics; what happens to organizations as they age; the extent to which organizations can find niches that protect them against competitive pressures; and questions of how best to define the identity of organizations. </jats:p>",
