    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses how to apply computational linguistics techniques to analyze largely unstructured corporate-generated text for economic analysis. As a core example, we illustrate how textual analysis of earnings conference call transcripts can provide insights into how markets and individual firms respond to economic shocks, such as a nuclear disaster or a geopolitical event: insights that often elude traditional non-text data sources. This approach enables extracting actionable intelligence, supporting both policy-making and strategic corporate decision-making. We also explore applications using other sources of corporate-generated text, including patent documents and job postings. By incorporating computational linguistics techniques into the analysis of economic shocks, new opportunities arise for real-time economic data, offering a more nuanced understanding of market and firm responses in times of economic volatility. </jats:p>",
