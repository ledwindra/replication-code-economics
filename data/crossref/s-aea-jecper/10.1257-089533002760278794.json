In general, the articles chosen will be expository or integrative and not focus on original research. They may include survey articles, discussion of related subjects in which economists might have an interest or analyses of economics from other perspectives. If you write or read an appropriate article, please send a copy of the article (and possibly a few sentences describing it) to Bernard Saffran, c/o Journal of Economic Perspectives, Department of Economics, Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA 19081. </jats:p>",
