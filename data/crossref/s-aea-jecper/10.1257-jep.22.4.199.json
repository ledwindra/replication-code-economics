    "abstract": "<jats:p> In economics and other sciences, \u201cstatistical significance\u201d is by custom, habit, and education a necessary and sufficient condition for proving an empirical result. The canonical routine is to calculate what's called a t-statistic and then to compare its estimated value against a theoretically expected value of it, which is found in \u201cStudent's\u201d t table. A result yielding a t-value greater than or equal to about 2.0 is said to be \u201cstatistically significant at the 95 percent level.\u201d Alternatively, a regression coefficient is said to be \u201cstatistically significantly different from the null, p &lt; .05.\u201d Canonically speaking, if a coefficient clears the 95 percent hurdle, it warrants additional scientific attention. If not, not. The first presentation of \u201cStudent's\u201d test of significance came a century ago in 1908, in \u201cThe Probable Error of a Mean,\u201d published by an anonymous \u201cStudent.\u201d The author's commercial employer required that his identity be shielded from competitors, but we have known for some decades that the article was written by William Sealy Gosset (1876\u20131937), whose entire career was spent at Guinness's brewery in Dublin, where Gosset was a master brewer and experimental scientist. Perhaps surprisingly, the ingenious \u201cStudent\u201d did not give a hoot for a single finding of \u201cstatistical\u201d significance, even at the 95 percent level of significance as established by his own tables. Beginning in 1904, \u201cStudent,\u201d who was a businessman besides a scientist, took an economic approach to the logic of uncertainty, arguing finally that statistical significance is \u201cnearly valueless\u201d in itself. </jats:p>",
