    "abstract": "<jats:p> The 2023 John Bates Clark Medal of the American Economic Association was awarded to Gabriel Zucman, associate professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley for his fundamental contributions to the study of inequality and taxation. Through meticulous empirical work and creative methodological approaches, he has revealed key trends about the concentration of global wealth, the size and distribution of tax evasion, and the tax-saving strategies of multinational companies. These findings have had a profound impact on the academic literature and on global policy debates. He has shifted the way economic research is done by showing that measurement can have a large impact in our field and on the world, inspiring many younger scholars to follow in his footsteps. </jats:p>",
