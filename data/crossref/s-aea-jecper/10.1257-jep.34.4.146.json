    "abstract": "<jats:p> We describe a frame work for empirical welfare analysis that uses the causal estimates of a policy\u2019s impact on net government spending. This framework provides guidance for which causal effects are (and are not) needed for empirical welfare analysis of public policies. The key ingredient is the construction of each policy\u2019s marginal value of public funds (MVPF). The MVPF is the ratio of beneficiaries\u2019 willingness to pay for the policy to the net cost to the government. We discuss how the MVPF relates to \u201ctraditional\u201d welfare analysis tools such as the marginal excess burden and marginal cost of public funds. We show how the MVPF can be used in practice by applying it to several canonical empirical applications from public finance, labor, development, trade, and industrial organization. </jats:p>",
