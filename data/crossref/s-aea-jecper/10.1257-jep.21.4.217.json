    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an account of the history of L\u00e9on Walras's attempt to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1906. It describes Walras's moves to get three of his Lausanne colleagues to nominate him for the prize, the arguments advanced in the proposal, and the reception that it received by the Norwegian Peace Prize Committee in Kristiania (Oslo). It discusses whether Walras had realistic reasons to believe that he stood a chance of winning the prize, and it evaluates the validity of the arguments on which the proposal was based. </jats:p>",
