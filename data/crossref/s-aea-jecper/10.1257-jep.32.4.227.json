    "abstract": "<jats:p> Last year marked the 200th anniversary of Ricardo\u2019s famous \u201cfour numbers\u201d paragraph on comparative advantage, which is one of the oldest analytical results in economics. Following the lead of James Mill (1821), these four numbers have been interpreted as unit labor coefficients. This interpretation has provided the basis for the development of the \u2018Ricardian model\u2019 from John Stuart Mill (1852) to Eaton and Kortum (2002). However, if we accept the labor unit interpretation of these numbers, Ricardo\u2019s exposition in his 1817 Principles of Political Economy and Taxation makes little logical sense. Building on Sraffa\u2019s (1930) interpretation of Ricardo\u2019s numbers as labor embodied in trade, our discussion reveals the amazing simplicity and generality of Ricardo\u2019s comparative advantage formulation and gains-from-trade logic. </jats:p>",
