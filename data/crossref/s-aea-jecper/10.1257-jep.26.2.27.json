    "abstract": "<jats:p> Editing isn't \u201cteaching\u201d and it isn't \u201cresearch,\u201d so in the holy trinity of academic responsibilities it is apparently bunched with faculty committees, student advising, and talks to the local Kiwanis club as part of \u201cservice.\u201d Yet for many economists, editing seems to loom larger in their professional lives. After all, EconLit indexes more than 750 academic journals of economics, which require an ever-shifting group of editors, co-editors, and advisory boards to function. Roughly one-third of the books in the annotated listings at the back of each issue of the Journal of Economic Literature are edited volumes. Here is one take on the enterprise of editing from someone who has been sitting in the Managing Editor's chair for all 100 issues of the Journal of Economic Perspectives since before the first issue of the journal mailed in Summer 1987. </jats:p>",
