    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2018, the editors of the Journal of Economic Perspectives invited faculty to send us examples of JEP articles that they had found useful for teaching. We received 250 responses. On the JEP website, we have created a landing page ( https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jep/classroom ) that organizes the recommended articles into 33 categories. If you click on any of the categories at that link, you will see a list of JEP papers that were recommended by faculty members for classroom use for that category, presented in reverse date order. Each paper is listed with a hyperlink to its article page on the JEP website. In this article, I offer some thoughts about how this exercise was carried out, along with its strengths and weaknesses. Although we make no pretense of presenting a complete syllabus for any specific course, we offer the milder hope that these recommendations from peers might suggest some additional readings for your students. </jats:p>",
