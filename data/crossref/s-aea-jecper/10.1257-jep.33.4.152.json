    "abstract": "<jats:p> Growing conventional wisdom holds that a chief driver of the populist vote is economic insecurity. I contend that this view overstates the role of economic insecurity as an explanation in several ways. First, it conflates the significance of economic insecurity in influencing the election outcome on the margin with its significance in explaining the overall populist vote. Empirical findings indicate that the share of populist support explained by economic insecurity is modest. Second, recent evidence indicates that voters\u2019 concern with immigration\u2014a key issue for many populist parties\u2014is only marginally shaped by its real or perceived repercussions on their economic standing. Third, economics-centric accounts of populism treat voters\u2019 cultural concerns as largely a byproduct of experiencing adverse economic change. This approach underplays the reverse process, whereby disaffection from social and cultural change drives both economic discontent and support for populism. </jats:p>",
