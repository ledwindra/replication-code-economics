    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reconsiders the evidence needed to answer pressing questions of economic history and racial inequality, the Third Phase of research on American Enslavement and its Aftermath. First, I briefly summarize how economists have sought to understand slavery as an institution. Second, using my family\u2019s narrative as a lens, I show how answers to questions from economic history and economic theory can be answered by expanding our evidentiary base and methodological approaches. In the process, I highlight some areas of what these \u201ctraditional\u201d economic perspectives miss. Finally, I briefly provide some examples from other fields\u2014such as recent work by historians\u2014that have sought to provide texture on some of the key dimensions of slavery and racial inequality that have been under-studied by economists. </jats:p>",
