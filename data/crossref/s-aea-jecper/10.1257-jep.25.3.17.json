We argue greater use should be made of experiments that identify the behavioral mechanisms that are central to clearly specified policy questions, what we call \u201cmechanism experiments.\u201d These types of experiments can be of great policy value even if the intervention that is tested (or its setting) does not correspond exactly to any realistic policy option. </jats:p>",
