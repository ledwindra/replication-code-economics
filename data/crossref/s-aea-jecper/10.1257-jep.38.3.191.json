    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since 1974, the American Economic Association Summer Training Program has provided training and mentoring to students from disadvantaged backgrounds in economics. The aim of the program is to encourage and prepare these students to apply to PhD programs in economics and ultimately to increase diversity in the profession. The program has been hosted by different universities over the years. This paper provides insights and lessons learned from the program\u2019s tenure at Michigan State University from 2016 to 2020. In addition to discussing the structure and outcomes of the program, we provide advice to students, faculty, and potential hosts who may be interested in the AEA Summer Program or similar programs. </jats:p>",
