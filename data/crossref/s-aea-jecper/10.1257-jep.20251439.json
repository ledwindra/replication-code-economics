    "abstract": "<jats:p> The US corporate bond market has expanded significantly, fueled by electronic trading, institutional innovation, and growing retail participation via mutual and exchange-traded funds. These developments have improved efficiency by reducing costs and enhancing transparency, yet they have also introduced new vulnerabilities. The market\u2019s shift from relationship-based to transaction-based trading has weakened its ability to absorb stress, especially during periods of widespread selling. We examine the structural changes that have reduced dealer intermediation, the limited liquidity benefits of electronic platforms, and the destabilizing role of fund flows. The COVID-19 crisis exposed these weaknesses, prompting the Federal Reserve to act as a \u201cmarket maker of last resort.\u201d We argue that while the market is \u201cbetter\u201d in many ways, enhancing resilience through transparency and long-term investor participation is essential for future stability. </jats:p>",
