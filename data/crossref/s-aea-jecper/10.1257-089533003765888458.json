This paper looks at expertise in the arts (movies, novels and musical interpretation) and shows that expert opinion given shortly after the work has been produced (Oscars, prizes, rankings in musical competitions) may influence success, though it does not always recognize talent and does often not survive the \u201ctest of time,\u201d considered by many art philosophers, since Hume, as one of the possible measures of fundamental aesthetic quality. </jats:p>",
