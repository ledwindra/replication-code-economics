    "abstract": "<jats:p> At nearly the same moment, Jeremy Bentham and Henry Thornton adopted diametrically opposed approaches to stabilizing the financial system. Henry Thornton eloquently defended the Bank of England\u2019s actions as the lender of last resort and saw its discretionary management of liquidity as the key stabilizer of the credit system. In contrast, Jeremy Bentham advocated the imposition of strict bank regulations and examinations, without which, he predicted, Britain would soon experience a systemic crisis\u2014which he called \u201cuniversal bankruptcy.\u201d There are strong parallels but also dramatic differences with our recent attempts to reduce systemic risk within financial systems. The Basel III bank regulatory framework effectively intertwines Bentham\u2019s and Thornton\u2019s diametrically opposed approaches to stabilizing banks. Yet Bentham\u2019s and Thornton\u2019s concerns regarding the stability of the wider financial system remain alive today due to financial innovation and the politics of responding to financial crises. </jats:p>",
