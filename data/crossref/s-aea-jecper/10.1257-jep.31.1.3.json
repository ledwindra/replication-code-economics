    "abstract": "<jats:p> It has been 40 years since Deng Xiaoping broke dramatically with Maoist ideology and the Maoist variant of socialism. Since then, China has been transformed. Forty years ago, in 1978, China was unquestionably a socialist economy of the familiar and well-studied \u201ccommand economy\u201d variant, even though it was more decentralized and more loosely planned than its Soviet progenitor. Twenty years ago\u2014that is, by the late 1990s\u2014China had completely discarded this type of socialism and was moving decisively to a market economy. China today is quite different both from the command economy of 40 years ago, and from the \u201cWild West Capitalism\u201d of 20 years ago. Throughout these enormous changes, China has always officially claimed to be socialist. Does the \u201csocialist\u201d label make sense when applied to China today? </jats:p>",
