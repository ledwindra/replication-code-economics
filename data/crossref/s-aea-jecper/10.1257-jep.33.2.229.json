    "abstract": "<jats:p> We are currently experiencing an outpouring of concern both popular and professional regarding technological unemployment. I shall be discussing an apparent about-turn on the subject by David Ricardo (1772\u20131823), who at different times, even in different chapters of the same book, and, indeed, even at different places in the same chapter, seemed to be on both sides of the argument as to whether technological unemployment should be a matter for concern. In a chapter entitled \u201cOn Machinery,\u201d added to the third edition of his Principles of Political Economy (1821), which comprises volume 1 of his Collected Works (1951\u201373), Ricardo announced that he had become concerned about the possibility, even likelihood, of technical change detrimental to labour\u2019s interests. However, in the very same \u201cOn Machinery\u201d chapter, Ricardo also outlined qualifications to show that there was little need for concern. Ricardo\u2019s opposing messages are reflected in contrasting reactions to the chapter \u201cOn Machinery.\u201d Some readers\u2014including Thomas Robert Malthus and J. R. McCulloch\u2014understood it as supporting working-class opposition to machinery. Others\u2014including John Stuart Mill and Sir John Hicks\u2014find therein the answer to such opposition </jats:p>",
