    "abstract": "<jats:p> Susan Carleton Athey is the 2007 recipient of the American Economic Association's John Bates Clark Medal, which is \u201cawarded biennially to that American economist under the age of forty who is adjudged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.\u201d I have had the immense pleasure of being Susan's teacher, her advisor, her coauthor, and her friend. Yet I never cease to be amazed at her abilities and her accomplishments on so many dimensions. The AEA specifically cited her work in four distinct areas: monotone information models; industrial organization and particularly auctions; macroeconomics; and econometrics. Yet there is even more breadth to Susan's research contributions than this suggests, as I will show. </jats:p>",
