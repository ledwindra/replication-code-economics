This type of data proved important for interpreting the causes and consequences of the Great Recession, and it has played a crucial role in shaping economists\u2019 understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic in near real-time. I discuss a number of specific insights from this research while also illustrating some of the broader opportunities and challenges of working with administrative data. </jats:p>",
