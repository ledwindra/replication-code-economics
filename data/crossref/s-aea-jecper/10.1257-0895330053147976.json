    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports the findings of a survey and interviews with graduate students at seven top-ranking graduate economics programs. It finds that over the last 15 years graduate economics programs have become more empirical, less mathematical and less theoretically oriented, and that the students are generally positive about the profession. It also finds fewer differences among school. Despite the improvements, and greater student satisfaction, the paper suggests that there are serious pedagogical questions about the focus of the core on mathematical techniques rather than on creativity and economic reasoning, which students see as the true core of economics. </jats:p>",
