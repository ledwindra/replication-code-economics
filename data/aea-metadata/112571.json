    "description": "We propose a collective labor supply model with household production\nthat generalizes a model of Blundell, Chiappori, and Meghir\n(2005). Adults' preferences depend not only on own leisure and individual private consumption of market goods. They also depend on\nthe consumption of domestic goods, which are produced by combining\nmarket goods with individuals' time. A new identification result,\nwhich uses production shifters, is developed. We apply our model to\nunique data on Dutch couples with children. Our application uses\na novel estimation strategy that builds upon the familiar two-stage\nallocation representation of the collective model. (JEL D12, J12, J22)",
