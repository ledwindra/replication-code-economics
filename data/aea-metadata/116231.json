    "description": "This paper addresses the question of how traditional institutions interact with the\nforces of globalization to shape the economic mobility and welfare of particular\ngroups of individuals in the new economy. We explore the role of one such\ntraditional institution\u0097the caste system\u0097in shaping career choices by gender in\nBombay using new survey data on school enrollment and income over the past 20\nyears. We find that male working-class\u0097lower-caste\u0097networks continue to channel\nboys into local language schools that lead to the traditional occupation, despite the\nfact that returns to nontraditional white-collar occupations rose substantially in the\n1990s, suggesting the possibility of a dynamic inefficiency. In contrast, lower-caste\ngirls, who historically had low labor market participation rates and so did not benefit\nfrom the network, are taking full advantage of the opportunities that became available\nin the new economy by switching rapidly to English schools.
