    "description": "Every year housing markets in the United Kingdom and the United\nStates experience systematic above-trend increases in prices and\ntransactions during the spring and summer (\"hot season\") and\nbelow-trend falls during the autumn and winter (\"cold season\").\nHouse price seasonality poses a challenge to existing housing models.\nWe propose a search-and-matching model with thick-market effects.\nIn thick markets, the quality of matches increases, rising buyers' willingness to pay and sellers' desire to transact. A small, deterministic\ndriver of seasonality can be amplified and revealed as deterministic\nseasonality in transactions and prices, quantitatively mimicking seasonal fluctuations in UK and US markets.
