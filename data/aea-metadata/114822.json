    "description": "Improving college performance and retention can be difficult. We\npropose a simple and low-cost change in the way colleges use the\nACT exam in their admission decisions that can greatly increase\ntheir ability to identify students at a high risk of underperforming\nand dropping out. Specifically, we show that only two of the four\nsubtests of the ACT, English and Mathematics, can effectively predict\noutcomes in college. This result is robust across various samples,\nspecifications and outcome measures. We demonstrate that by\neliminating the noise associated with the two nonpredictive subtests,\nstudent-college matches can be significantly improved. (JEL I23)",
