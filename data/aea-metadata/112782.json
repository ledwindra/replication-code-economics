    "description": "A typical strategy for measuring the returns to international experience\u2014comparing the earnings of returning migrants to comparable non-migrants\u2014has been criticized for not adequately accounting for self-selection. I suggest an alternative, testing whether individuals born beyond US borders, but into US citizenship, earn more in US labor markets relative to counterparts born on US soil. Those born abroad to US citizens did not self-select an international experience. Using the ACS, I find that the US market rewards international experience, especially in occupations that value creativity and innovation.  Women, in particular, are handsomely rewarded for international human capital.",
