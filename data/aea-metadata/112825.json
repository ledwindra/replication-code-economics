    "description": "We study the effect of U.S. food aid on conflict in recipient countries. Our analysis exploits\ntime variation in food aid shipments due to changes in U.S. wheat production and cross-sectional\nvariation in a country's tendency to receive any U.S. food aid. According to our estimates, an\nincrease in U.S. food aid increases the incidence and duration of civil conflicts, but has no robust\neffect on inter-state conflicts or the onset of civil conflicts. We also provide suggestive evidence\nthat the effects are most pronounced in countries with a recent history of civil conflict.",
