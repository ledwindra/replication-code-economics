    "description": "We examine the contagion effect of residential foreclosures and find\nstrong evidence of a social interactions influence on default decisions\nwhere the interaction is based on neighbors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behavior in a\nprevious period. Using a unique spatially explicit parcel-level dataset\ndocumenting residential foreclosures in Maryland for the years\n2006-2009 and a highly localized neighborhood definition, based on\n13 nearest neighbors, we find that a neighbor in foreclosure increases\nthe hazard of additional defaults by 18 percent. This feedback effect\ngoes beyond a temporary reduction in local house prices and implies\na negative social multiplier effect of foreclosures. (JEL R23, R31)",
