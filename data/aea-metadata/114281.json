    "description": "Using time-varying BVARs, we find a substantial decline in the shortrun\nprice elasticity of oil demand since the mid-1980s. This finding\nhelps explain why an oil production shortfall of the same magnitude\nis associated with a stronger response of oil prices and more severe\nmacroeconomic consequences over time, while a similar oil price\nincrease is associated with smaller output effects. Oil supply shocks\nalso account for a smaller fraction of real oil price variability in\nmore recent periods, in contrast to oil demand shocks. The overall\neffects of oil supply disruptions on the US economy have, however,\nbeen modest.",
