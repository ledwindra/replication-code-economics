    "description": "This paper reports on a randomized evaluation of a program designed to improve high school graduation and postsecondary education enrollment among low-performing high school students. Treated youths were offered mentoring, educational services, and financial rewards. The program was evaluated when the youths were 19, 21, and 24 years old. Treated youths obtained their high school diplomas\nearlier and were more likely than controls to attend postsecondary\neducation. Five years after the end of the program, we find no significant\noverall effects of this intervention on employment outcomes. The program improved outcomes to a greater extent for the female enrollees than the male ones. (JEL D83, I21, I28, J13)",
