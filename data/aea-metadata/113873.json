    "description": "This paper presents evidence on the perverse trade-off that first price\nauctions induce between low prices at the awarding stage and poor\nex post performance when bids are not binding commitments. By\nexploiting the different timing with which first price auctions were\nintroduced in Italy to procure public works, this study finds that\nat least half of the cost savings from lower winning prices are lost\nbecause of ex post renegotiation. Screening the lowest price bid for\nits responsiveness prevents performance worsening but also reduces\nthe initial cost savings by a third and induces delays in awarding the\ncontract.",
