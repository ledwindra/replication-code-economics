    "description": "Simultaneity complicates the estimation of the causal effect of police\non crime. We overcome this obstacle by focusing on a mass layoff of\nOregon State Police in February of 2003. Due solely to budget cuts,\n35 percent of the roadway troopers were laid off, which dramatically\nreduced citations. The subsequent decrease in enforcement is\nassociated with a significant increase in injuries and fatalities. The\neffects are similar using control groups chosen either geographically\nor through data-driven methods. Our estimates suggest that a highway\nfatality can be prevented with $309,000 of expenditures on state\npolice.",
