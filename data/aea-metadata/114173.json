    "description": "The rapid growth of international reserves, a development concentrated\nin the emerging markets, remains a puzzle. In this paper, we\nsuggest that a model based on financial stability and financial openness\ngoes far toward explaining reserve holdings in the modern era\nof globalized capital markets. The size of domestic financial liabilities\nthat could potentially be converted into foreign currency (M2),\nfinancial openness, the ability to access foreign currency through\ndebt markets, and exchange rate policy are all significant predictors\nof reserve stocks. Our empirical financial-stability model seems to\noutperform both traditional models and recent explanations based\non external short-term debt. (JEL E23, E43, E44, F31, F32, F34)",
