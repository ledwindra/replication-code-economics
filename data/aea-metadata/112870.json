    "description": "We argue that US welfare would rise if unemployment insurance\nwere increased for younger and decreased for older workers. This\nis because the young tend to lack the means to smooth consumption\nduring unemployment and want jobs to accumulate high-return human capital. So unemployment insurance is most valuable to\nthem, while moral hazard is mild. By calibrating a life cycle model\nwith unemployment risk and endogenous search effort, we find that\nallowing unemployment replacement rates to decline with age yields\nsizeable welfare gains to US workers.
