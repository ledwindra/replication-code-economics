    "description": "This paper shows how two standard models of consumption\nrisk-sharing\u2014self-insurance through borrowing and saving and\nlimited commitment to insurance contracts\u2014replicate similarly well\nthe standard, second-moment measures of insurance observed in US\nmicro data. A nonparametric analysis, however, reveals strongly\ncontrasting and counterfactual joint distributions of consumption,\nincome and wealth. Method of moments estimation shows how\nmeasurement error in consumption eliminates excessive skewness\nand smoothness of consumption growth. Moreover, counterfactual\nnonlinearities disappear at high-estimated risk aversion under selfinsurance,\nbut are a robust feature of limited commitment. Its \"shape\nof insurance\" thus argues in favor of the self-insurance model.",
