    "description": "Automobile manufacturers frequently use promotions involving cash incentives.\nWhile payments are nominally directed to either customers or dealers, the ultimate\nbeneficiary of the promotion depends on the outcome of price negotiation. We use\nprogram evaluation methods to compare the incidence of these two types of\npromotions. Customers obtain 70 to 90 percent of a customer rebate, but only 30 to\n40 percent of a dealer discount promotion, a $500 difference for a typical promotion.\nOur leading hypothesis is that pass-through rates differ because of information\nasymmetries: customer rebates are well-publicized to customers, while dealer\ndiscount promotions are not.
