    "description": "This paper analyzes how bounded rationality affects monetary and fiscal policy via an empirically-relevant enrichment of the New Keynesian model. It models agents' partial myopia towards distant atypical events using a new microfounded cognitive discounting parameter. Compared to the rational model: (i) there is no forward guidance puzzle; (ii) the Taylor principle changes \u2014 with passive monetary policy but enough myopia equilibria are determinate and economies stable; (iii) the zero lower bound is much less costly; (iv) price-level targeting is not optimal; (v) fiscal stimulus is effective; (vi) the model is neo-Fisherian in the long run, Keynesian in the short run.",
