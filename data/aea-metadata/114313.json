    "description": "The Winner's Curse (WC) is a robust and persistent deviation\nfrom theoretical predictions established in experimental economics\nand claimed to exist in field environments. Recent attempts to\nreconcile such deviation include \"cursed equilibrium\" and level-k\nreasoning. We design and implement a simplified version of the\nAcquiring-a-Company game that transformed the game to an individual-choice problem that still retains the adverse-selection problem.\nWe further simplified the problem so that simple ordinal reasoning\ncould replace both Bayesian updating and contingent thinking. Our\nresults suggest that the WC reflects bounded rationality in that people\nhave difficulties performing contingent reasoning on future events.\n(JEL D81, D82)",
