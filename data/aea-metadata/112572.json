    "description": "This paper explores the links between exports, export destinations,\nand skill utilization. We identify two mechanisms behind these links:\ndifferences across destinations in quality valuation and in exporting\nrequired services, activities that are intensive in skilled labor.\nDepending on the characteristics of the source country (income,\nlanguage), the theories suggest a skill-bias in export destinations.\nWe test the theory using a panel of Argentine manufacturing firms.\nWe find that Argentine firms exporting to high-income countries\nhired more skilled workers than other exporters and domestic firms.\nInstead, we cannot identify any causal effect of exporting per se on\nskill utilization.
