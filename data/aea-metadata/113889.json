    "description": "Using panel data from a large hospital system, this paper presents\nestimates of the productivity effects of human capital in a team production environment. Proxying nurses' general human capital by\neducation and their unit-specific human capital by experience on the\nnursing unit, we find that greater amounts of both types of human\ncapital significantly improve patient outcomes. Disruptions to team\nfunctioning attributable to the departure of experienced nurses, the\nabsorption of new hires, and the inclusion of temporary contract\nnurses are associated with significant decreases in productivity\nbeyond those attributable to changes in nurses' skill and experience.",
