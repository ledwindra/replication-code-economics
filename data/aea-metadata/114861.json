    "description": "This paper exploits the effectively random assignment of judges to\nDisability Insurance cases to estimate the causal impact of Disability\nInsurance receipt on labor supply. We find that benefit receipt reduces\nlabor force participation by 26 percentage points three years after a\ndisability determination decision, although the reduction is smaller\nfor older people, college graduates, and those with mental illness.\nOLS and instrumental variables estimates are similar. Furthermore,\nover 60 percent of those denied benefits by an administrative law\njudge are subsequently allowed benefits within ten years, showing\nthat most applicants apply, reapply, and appeal until they get benefits.",
