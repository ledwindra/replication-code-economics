    "description": "I develop a New Keynesian model in which a type of government\nmultiplier doubles when unemployment rises from 5 percent to\n8 percent. This multiplier indicates the additional number of workers\nemployed when one worker is hired in the public sector. Graphically,\nin equilibrium, an upward-sloping quasi-labor supply intersects a\ndownward-sloping labor demand in a (employment, labor market\ntightness) plane. Increasing public employment stimulates labor\ndemand, which increases tightness and therefore crowds out private\nemployment. Critically, the quasi-labor supply is convex. Hence,\nwhen labor demand is depressed and unemployment is high, the\nincrease in tightness and resulting crowding-out are small.",
