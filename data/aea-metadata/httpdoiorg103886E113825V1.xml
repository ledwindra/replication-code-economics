                    <dc:description>This paper evaluates the impact of three major expansions in maternity
leave coverage in Germany on children's long-run outcomes. To identify the causal impact of the reforms, we use a difference-indifference design that compares outcomes of children born shortly before and shortly after a change in maternity leave legislation
in years of policy changes, and in years when no changes have taken place. We find no support for the hypothesis that the expansions in leave coverage improved children's outcomes, despite a
strong impact on mothers' return to work behavior after childbirth. (JEL J13, J16, J22, J32)</dc:description>
