    "description": "Using nationally representative data files from 1970s and 1990s college\nattendees, we find that in the 1970s matriculation at historically\nblack colleges and universities (HBCUs) was associated with\nhigher wages and an increased probability of graduation, relative to\nattending a traditionally white institution. By the 1990s, there is a\nwage penalty resulting in a 20 percent decline in the relative wages\nof HBCU graduates between the two decades. There is modest support\nfor the possibility that the relative decline in wages associated\nwith HBCU matriculation is partially due to improvements in TWIs'\neffectiveness at educating blacks.
