    "description": "Incomplete product availability is an important feature of many\nmarkets, and ignoring changes in availability may bias demand\nestimates. We study a new dataset from a wireless inventory system\non vending machines to track product availability every four\nhours. The data allow us to account for product availability when\nestimating demand, and provide valuable variation for identifying\nsubstitution patterns when products stock out. We develop a\nprocedure that allows for changes in product availability when\navailability is only observed periodically. We find significant\ndifferences in demand estimates: the corrected model predicts\nsignificantly larger impacts of stock-out events on profitability.",
