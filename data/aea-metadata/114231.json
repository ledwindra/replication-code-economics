    "description": "The goal of this paper is to examine the role of taxes and productivity growth as forces influencing market hours. To achieve this goal, the paper considers a calibrated growth model extended to include home production and subsistence consumption, both of which are found to be key features influencing market hours. The model is simulated for 15 OECD countries. The primary force driving changes in market\nhours is found to be changing labor income tax rates. Productivity catch-up relative to the United States is found to be an important secondary force. (JEL E24, H24, H31, J22, J24)",
