    "description": "Half a century of economic research asks how economic inequality evolves during aggregate economic progress. I extend this literature to quantify inequality in the incidence of child death across mothers and study its evolution during aggregate mortality decline. Data from 238 household surveys in 79 developing countries show that as child mortality falls in aggregate, it becomes more unequally distributed across mothers.",
