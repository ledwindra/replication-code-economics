    "description": "By using graphical representations of simple portfolio choice problems, we generate\na very rich dataset to study behavior under uncertainty at the level of the individual\nsubject. We test the data for consistency with the maximization hypothesis,\nand we estimate preferences using a two-parameter utility function based on Faruk\nGul (1991). This specification provides a good interpretation of the data at the individual\nlevel and can account for the highly heterogeneous behaviors observed in\nthe laboratory. The parameter estimates jointly describe attitudes toward risk and\nallow us to characterize the distribution of risk preferences in the population. (JEL\nD11, D14, D81, G11)",
