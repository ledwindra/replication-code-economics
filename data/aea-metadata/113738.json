    "description": "Are the English proficiency and social outcomes of US immigrants\nthe result of their cultural preferences or of more fundamental constraints?\nUsing 2000 census microdata, we relate the English proficiency,\nmarriage, fertility, and residential location variables of\nimmigrants to their age at the time of arrival in the United States,\nand, in particular, whether that age fell within the \"critical period\"\nof language acquisition. We interpret the differences between\nyounger and older arrivers as effects of English language skills and\nconstruct an instrumental variable for English language skills. Two-stage-least-squares estimates suggest English proficiency increases\nthe likelihood of divorce and intermarriage. It decreases fertility\nand, for some, ethnic\nenclave residence.
