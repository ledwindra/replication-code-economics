    "description": "The proposed 2008 TARP auction was intended to remove \"toxic\"\nassets from portfolios of financially stressed banks. The Treasury\nselected a design whereby bids to sell different securities would\nbe normalized by \"reference prices\" that reflect relative value\nestimates. We conduct a series of experiments indicating that a simple\nReference Price Auction can be an effective mechanism for avoiding\nserious effects of adverse selection and strategic bid manipulation,\neven with inaccurate reference prices. Beyond the TARP auction,\nour results are relevant to various multi-object auctions with value\nheterogeneity.",
