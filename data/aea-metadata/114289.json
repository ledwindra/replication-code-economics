    "description": "We argue that credit constraints not only amplify fundamental shocks,\nthey can also lead to self-fulfilling business cycles. We study a model\nwith heterogeneous firms, in which imperfect contract enforcement\nimplies that productive firms face binding credit constraints, with\nthe borrowing capacity limited by expected equity value. A drop in\nequity value tightens credit constraints and reallocates resources\nfrom productive to unproductive firms. Such reallocation reduces\naggregate productivity, further depresses equity value, generating\na financial multiplier. Aggregate dynamics are isomorphic to those\nin a representative-agent economy with increasing returns. For\nsufficiently tight credit constraints, the model generates self-fulfilling\nbusiness cycles.",
