    "description": "Investments in fiscal capacity\u2014economic institutions for tax compliance\u2014are an important feature of economic development. This paper\ndevelops a dynamic model to study the evolution of fiscal capacity\nover time. We contrast a social planner's investment path with politically\nfeasible paths. Three types of states emerge in the long run: a\ncommon-interest state where public resources are devoted to public\ngoods, a redistributive state where additional fiscal capacity is used\nfor transfers, and a weak state with no transfers and a low level of\npublic goods provision. We also present some preliminary evidence\nconsistent with the theory.",
