    "description": "We investigate a channel through which social capital may improve\neconomic well-being and the functioning of institutions: political\naccountability. The main idea is that voters who share values and\nbeliefs that foster cooperation are more likely to vote based on criteria\nof social welfare rather than narrow personal interest. We frame this\nintuition into a simple model of political agency and take it to the data\nusing information on the criminal prosecutions and absenteeism rates\nof Italian members of Parliament. Empirical evidence shows that the\nelectoral punishment of these misbehaviors is considerably larger in\ndistricts with higher social capital. (JEL D72, I31, Z13)",
