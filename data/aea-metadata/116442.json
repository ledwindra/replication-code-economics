    "description": "Firms engage in foggy pricing when the menu of tariff options aims\nat profiting from consumer mistakes. The analysis of this paper\nconcludes that the transition from monopoly to competition in the\nearly US cellular telephone industry does not generally foster the\nuse of such deceptive strategies. I offer three alternative measures\nto account for the fogginess of the menu of options offered by cellular\ncarriers. All results are robust to the existence of uncertainty\nregarding future consumption at the time of choosing a particular\ntariff option, as well as to consumers' heterogeneity with respect to\ncellular telephone usage.
