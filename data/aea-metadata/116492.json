    "description": "This study investigates whether gender differences in SET vary over the course of a semester, particularly in response to feedback from the instructor. We survey principles of economics courses at multiple institutions three times during the semester to analyze whether the evaluations of male and female instructors change throughout the term, specifically after the first exam is returned. Results indicate a negative effect on evaluations for female instructors relative to male instructors associated with returning grades. This work shows the importance of understanding the dynamics of changes in evaluations within a course over the semester.",
