    "description": "Previous research has not always found that boys and girls are treated\ndifferently in rural India. However estimates of the effect of gender on\nparental investments could be biased if girls end up in larger families\ndue to son-biased stopping rules. Using a novel identification strategy\nthat exploits that gender at conception is random, we document that\nboys receive more childcare time than girls, they are breastfed longer\nand they get more vitamin supplementation. Compared to other\ndeveloping countries, boys have an advantage in height and weight\nrelative to girls. Neither greater needs nor anticipated family size\nexplain the results.",
