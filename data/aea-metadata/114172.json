    "description": "We measure the extent to which skilled immigrants increase innovation\nin the United States. The 2003 National Survey of College\nGraduates shows that immigrants patent at double the native rate,\ndue to their disproportionately holding science and engineering\ndegrees. Using a 1940-2000 state panel, we show that a 1 percentage\npoint increase in immigrant college graduates' population share\nincreases patents per capita by 9-18 percent. Our instrument for the\nchange in the skilled immigrant share is based on the 1940 distribution\nacross states of immigrants from various source regions and\nthe subsequent national increase in skilled immigration from these\nregions.
