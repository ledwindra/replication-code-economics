    "description": "This paper studies a new strategic auditing game in which atomistic\nauditors maximize the success rate of audits, and provides a method\nto calibrate its parameters based on audit data. Calibrating the\nmodel to Italian auditing data, we provide an estimate of tax evasion\nbased on (non-random) audit data alone. Counterfactual simulation\nof the model quantifies the costs and benefits of alternative auditing\npolicies. We compare decentralized enforcement with a counterfactual\n\"commitment policy,\" and compute the loss from the former.\n(JEL H25, H26, M42)",
