    "description": "We analyze geographic patterns of trade between individuals using\ntransactions data from eBay and MercadoLibre, two large online\nauction sites. We find that distance continues to be an important\ndeterrent to trade between geographically separated buyers and sellers,\nthough to a lesser extent than has been observed in studies of\nnon-Internet commerce between business counterparties. We also\nfind a strong \"home bias\" for trading with counterparties located in\nthe same city. Further analyses suggest that location-specific goods\nsuch as opera tickets, cultural factors, and the possibility of direct\ncontract enforcement in case of breach may be the main reasons\nbehind the same-city bias.
