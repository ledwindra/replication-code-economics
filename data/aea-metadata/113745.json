    "description": "We collect data on the rules and practices of financial and conflict\ndisclosure by members of Parliament in 175 countries. Although two-thirds\nof the countries have some disclosure laws, less than one-third\nmake disclosures available to the public, and less than one-sixth of\npotentially useful information is publicly available in practice, on\naverage. Countries that are richer, more democratic, and have free\npress have more disclosure. Public disclosure, but not internal disclosure\nto parliament, is positively related to government quality,\nincluding lower corruption. (JEL J13, I21, I12)",
