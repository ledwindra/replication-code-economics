    "description": "We evaluate the effect of smoking bans and excise taxes on the exposure\nto tobacco smoke of nonsmokers, and we show their unintended\nconsequences on children. Smoking bans perversely increase nonsmokers'\nexposure by displacing smokers to private places where\nthey contaminate nonsmokers. We exploit data on bio-samples of\ncotinine, time use, and smoking cessation, as well as state and time\nvariation in anti-smoking policies across US states. We find that\nhigher taxes are an efficient way to decrease exposure to tobacco\nsmoke. (JEL D12, H25, I12, I18, J13)",
