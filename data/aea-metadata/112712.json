    "description": "We estimate an insurer-specific preference function which rationalizes\nhospital referrals for privately insured births in California. The function\nis additively separable in: a hospital price paid by the insurer,\nthe distance traveled, and plan- and severity-specific hospital fixed\neffects (capturing hospital quality). We use an inequality estimator\nthat allows for errors in price and detailed hospital-severity interactions and obtain markedly different results than those from a logit. The estimates indicate that insurers with more capitated physicians are more responsive to price. Capitated plans send patients further to utilize similar quality, lower-priced hospitals; but the cost-quality trade-off does not vary with capitation rates. (JEL G22, H51, I11, I13, I18, J44)",
