    "description": "We study the effect of communication in an experimental game where\ncooperation is consistent with equilibrium play if players share\nan understanding that cheating will be punished. Consistent with\ncommunication acting as a coordinating device, credible preplay\nthreats to punish cheating are the most effective message to facilitate\ncollusion. Promises to collude also improve cooperation. Credible\nthreats do not occur in a treatment with a limited message space\nthat permits threats of punishment. Contrary to some theoretical\npredictions, renegotiation possibilities facilitate collusion.",
