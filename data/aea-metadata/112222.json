This paper uses administrative microdata to examine the impact of enforcement efforts\non taxpayers\u2019 reporting of offshore accounts and income. We find that enforcement caused approximately 50,000 individuals to disclose offshore accounts with a combined value of\nabout $100 billion. Most disclosures happened outside offshore voluntary disclosure\nprograms, by individuals who never admitted prior noncompliance. Disclosed accounts were\nconcentrated in countries often characterized as tax havens. Enforcement-driven disclosures increased annual reported capital income by $2-$4 billion, corresponding to $0.6-$1.2 billion in additional tax revenue.nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
