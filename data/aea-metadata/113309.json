    "description": "There is economic pressure to postpone the retirement age, but employers are\nstill reluctant to employ older workers. We investigate the comparative behavior\nof juniors and seniors in experiments conducted both onsite with the employees\nof two large firms and in a conventional laboratory environment with students\nand retirees. We show that seniors are no more risk averse than juniors and are\ntypically more cooperative; both juniors and working seniors respond strongly\nto competition. The implication is that it may be beneficial to define additional\nincentives near the end of the career to motivate and retain older workers. (JEL\nC90, J14, J26, M12, M51)",
