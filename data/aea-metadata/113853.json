    "description": "We show that pregnant women whose first clinic visit coincides with\nthe nurse's attendance are 58 percentage points more likely to test for\nHIV and 46 percent more likely to deliver in a hospital. Furthermore,\nwomen with high pretest expectations of being HIV positive, whose\nvisit coincides with nurse attendance, are 25 and 7.4 percentage\npoints more likely to deliver in a hospital and receive PMTCT medication, and 9 percentage points less likely to breast-feed than women whose visit coincides with nurse absence. The shortcomings that prevent pregnant women from testing on a subsequent visit are common in sub-Saharan Africa. (JEL I12, J16, O15)",
