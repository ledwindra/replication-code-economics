    "description": "Using administrative payroll data from the largest U.S. payroll processing company, we measure the extent of nominal wage rigidity in the United States.nbsp; nbsp;The data allow us to define a worker's per-period base contract wage separately from other forms of compensation such as overtime premiums and bonuses.nbsp; We provide evidence that firms use base wages to cyclically adjust the marginal cost of their workers.nbsp; Nominal base wage declines are much rarer than previously thought with only 2% of job-stayers receiving a nominal base wage cut during a given year. Approximately 35% of workers receive no base wage change year over year. We document strong evidence of both time and state dependence in nominal base wage adjustments.nbsp; nbsp;In addition, we provide evidence that the flexibility of new hire base wages is similar to that of existing workers. Collectively, our results can be used to discipline models of nominal wage rigidity.",
