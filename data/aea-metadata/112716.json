    "description": "We conduct the first empirical investigation of common-pool\nresource users' dynamic and strategic behavior at the micro level\nusing real-world data. Fishermen's strategies in a fully dynamic\ngame account for latent resource dynamics and other players'\nactions, revealing the profit structure of the fishery. We compare the\nfishermen's actual and socially optimal exploitation paths under\na time-specific vessel allocation policy and find a sizable dynamic\nexternality. Individual fishermen respond to other users by exerting\neffort above the optimal level early in the season. Congestion\nis costly instantaneously but is beneficial in the long run because it\npartially offsets dynamic inefficiencies. (JEL D24, Q21, Q22)",
