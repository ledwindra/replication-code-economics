    "description": "We argue that \u0093narrow framing,\u0094 whereby an agent who is offered a new gamble\nevaluates that gamble in isolation, may be a more important feature of decisionmaking\nthan previously realized. Our starting point is the evidence that people are\noften averse to a small, independent gamble, even when the gamble is actuarially\nfavorable. We find that a surprisingly wide range of utility functions, including many\nnonexpected utility specifications, have trouble explaining this evidence, but that\nthis difficulty can be overcome by allowing for narrow framing. Our analysis makes\npredictions as to what kinds of preferences can most easily address the stock market\nparticipation puzzle. (JEL D81, G11)",
