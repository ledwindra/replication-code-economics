    "description": "We document the presence of multiple and varied constraints to small\nand medium firm growth. This presents both a practical problem for\nbusiness training programs and a challenge to academic economists\ntrying to identify mechanisms though which these programs may affect\noutcomes. External validity needs theory. This pushes researchers to\nnarrowly defined and highly selected sample frames, which limits the\npotential for clear, generalizable policy prescriptions. Ultimately,\nlarger samples, multi-arm evaluations, process documentation, and\nnarrowly-focused, theory-supported empirical work are all needed,\nbut the complexity of the problem limits what we learn from any\nsingle study.",
