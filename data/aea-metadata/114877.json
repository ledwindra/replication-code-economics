    "description": "We provide the first comprehensive estimates of the size of the for-profit higher education sector and evaluate whether for-profits increase tuition in response to federal subsidies. By using state administrative data we include institutions that do not participate in federal student aid programs and are missed in official counts. Including these institutions doubles the number of for-profits and increases students by one-third compared with official counts. Aid-eligible institutions charge tuition for sub-baccalaureate (mainly certificate) programs that is about 78 percent higher than that charged by comparable programs in nonparticipating institutions, lending some credence to the \"Bennett hypothesis\" of federal aid capture.",
