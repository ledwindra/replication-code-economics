    "description": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe investigate the use of high-powered incentives for Colombian\narmy members, and show that it produced several perverse side effects. Innocent civilians were killed and misrepresented as guerillas (a phenomenon known in Colombia as \u2018false positives\u2019). There\nwere significantly more false positives during the period of high-\npowered incentives in municipalities with weaker judicial institutions and where a higher share of brigades were commanded by\ncolonels (who have stronger career concerns than generals). In\nmunicipalities with a higher share of colonels, the high-powered incentives period also coincided with a worsening of local judicial\ninstitutions and no discernible improvement in overall security.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
