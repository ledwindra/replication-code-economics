    "description": "The onset of World War I spurred the \"Great Migration\" of African\nAmericans from the US South, arguably the most important internal\nmigration in US history. We create a new panel dataset of more than\n5,000 men matched from the 1910 to 1930 census manuscripts to\naddress three interconnected questions: To what extent was there\nselection into migration? How large were the migrants' gains?\nDid migration narrow the racial gap in economic status? We find\nevidence of positive selection, but the migrants' gains were large.\nA substantial amount of black-white convergence in this period is\nattributable to migration.",
