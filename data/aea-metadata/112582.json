    "description": "In a series of studies employing a variety of approaches, we have found that the potential impact of climate change on US agriculture is likely negative. Desch\u00c3\u00aanes and Greenstone (2007) report\ndramatically different results based on regressions of agricultural profits and yields on weather variables. The divergence is explained by (1) missing and incorrect weather and climate data in their study; (2) their use of older climate change projections rather than the more recent and less optimistic projections from the Fourth Assessment Report; and (3) difficulties in their profit measure due to the confounding effects of storage.",
