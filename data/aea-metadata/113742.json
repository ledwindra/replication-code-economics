    "description": "This paper examines the importance of network-based intergenerational\ncorrelations in South Africa. I use longitudinal data\non young South Africans to examine the covariance of children's\nemployment with the usefulness of parents in their job search. I find\nthat fathers serve as useful network connections to their sons (not\ndaughters), and that mothers do not seem to be useful network connections.\nThe father-son effect is robust to alternate explanations\nof specific human capital and correlated networks. The size of this\neffect is large. Present fathers' utility as network connections may be\nresponsible for a one-third increase in their sons' employment rates.\n(JEL D31, J12, J13, J24, J62, O15, Z13)",
