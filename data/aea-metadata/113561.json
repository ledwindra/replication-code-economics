    "description": "We investigate the role of racial group loyalty on generosity in a\nbroadly representative sample of the US adult population. We use\nan audiovisual presentation to manipulate beliefs about the race,\nincome, and worthiness of Hurricane Katrina victims. Respondents\nthen decide how to divide $100 between themselves and Katrina\nvictims. We find no effects of victims' race on giving on average.\nHowever, respondents who report feeling close to their racial or ethnic\ngroup give substantially more when victims are of the same race,\nwhile respondents who do not feel close to their group give substantially\nless.
