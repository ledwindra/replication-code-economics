    "description": "I examine the causal effect of bank failures during the Great\nDepression using the quasi-experimental setup of Richardson and\nTroost (2009). The experiment is based on Mississippi being divided\ninto two Federal Reserve districts, which followed different policies\nfor liquidity provision. This translated into variation in bank failures\nacross the state. Employing a plant-level sample from the Census\nof Manufactures, I find that banking failures had a negative effect\non revenue stemming from a fall in physical output. I find no effect on\nemployment at the plant-level and a large decline at the county-level.\n(JEL E32, E44, G21, G33, N12, N22, N92)",
