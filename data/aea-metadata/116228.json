    "description": "In an experiment, players' ability to learn to cooperate in the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma was substantially diminished when the payoffs were noisy, even though\nplayers could monitor one another\u0092s past actions perfectly. In contrast, in one-time\nplay against a succession of opponents, noisy payoffs increased cooperation, by\nslowing the rate at which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent\nwith the robust observation from the psychology literature that partial reinforcement\n(adding randomness to the link between an action and its consequences while\nholding expected payoffs constant) slows learning. This effect is magnified in the\nrepeated game: when others are slow to learn to cooperate, the benefits of cooperation\nare reduced, which further hampers cooperation. These results show that a\nsmall change in the payoff environment, which changes the speed of individual\nlearning, can have a large effect on collective behavior. And they show that there\nmay be interesting comparative dynamics that can be derived from careful attention\nto the fact that at least some economic behavior is learned from experience.
