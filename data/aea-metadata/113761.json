    "description": "Temporary-help jobs offer rapid entry into paid employment, but they are typically brief and it is unknown whether they foster longer term\nemployment. We utilize the unique structure of Detroit's welfare-to-\nwork program to identify the effect of temporary-help jobs on labor market advancement. Exploiting the rotational assignment of welfare clients to numerous nonprofit contractors with differing job placement rates, we find that temporary-help job placements do\nnot improve and may diminish subsequent earnings and employment outcomes among participants. In contrast, job placements with direct-hire employers substantially raise earnings and employment over a seven quarter follow-up period. (JEL J22, J23, J24, J31, J68)",
