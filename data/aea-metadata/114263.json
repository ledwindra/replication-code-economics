    "description": "This paper introduces a notion of firm size into a search and matching\nmodel with endogenous job destruction. The outcome is a rich,\nyet analytically tractable framework that can be used to analyze a\nbroad set of features of both the cross-section and aggregate dynamics of the labor market. The model provides a coherent account of the distributions of employer size and employment growth across establishments, the amplitude and propagation of cyclical fluctuations in worker flows, the negative comovement of unemployment and vacancies, and the dynamics of the distribution of employer size over the business cycle.
