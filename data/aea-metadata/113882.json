    "description": "This paper analyzes Thailand's 2001 healthcare reform, \"30 Baht.\"\nThe program increased funding available to hospitals to care for\nthe poor and reduced copays to 30 Baht (~$0.75). Our estimates\nsuggest the supply-side funding of the program increased healthcare\nutilization, especially among the poor. Moreover, we find significant\nimpacts on infant mortality. Prior to 30 Baht, poorer provinces had\nsignificantly higher infant mortality rates than richer provinces.\nAfter 30 Baht, this correlation evaporates to zero. The results suggest\nthat increased access to healthcare among the poor can significantly\nreduce their infant mortality rates.",
