    "description": "How can consumers be assured that firms will endeavor to provide\ngood quality when quality is unobservable prior to purchase? We\ntest the hypothesis that reputational incentives are effective at causing\nrestaurants to maintain good hygiene quality. We find that chain\naffiliation provides reputational incentives and franchised units tend\nto free-ride on chain reputation. We also show that regional variation\nin the degree of repeat customers affects the strength of reputational\nincentives for good hygiene at both chain and nonchain restaurants.\nDespite these incentives, a policy intervention in the form of posted\nhygiene grade cards causes significant improvements in restaurant\nhygiene.
