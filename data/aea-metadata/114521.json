    "description": "We use state-of-the-art, satellite-based PM 2.5 data products to assess the extent to which the Environmental Protection Agency's existing, monitor-based measurements over- or underestimate true exposure to PM 2.5 pollution. Treating satellite-based estimates as truth implies a substantial number of \"policy errors\"\u2014overregulating areas that are in compliance with the air quality standards and under-regulating other areas that appear to be in violation. We investigate the health implications of these apparent errors. We also highlight the importance of accounting for prediction error in satellite-based estimates. Once prediction errors are accounted for, conclusions with regards to \"policy errors\" become substantially more uncertain.",
