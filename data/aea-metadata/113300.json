    "description": "This paper develops a model in which a desire to avoid criticism prompts\notherwise public-spirited bureaucrats to behave inefficiently. Decisions\nare taken to keep interest groups quiet and to keep mistakes out of the public\neye. The policy implications of this \"minimal squawk\" behavior are\nat odds with the view that agencies should be structured to minimize the\nthreat of \"capture.\" An empirical test using data from US State Public\nUtility Commissions rejects the capture hypothesis and is consistent with\nthe squawk hypothesis: longer PUC terms of office are associated with\na higher incidence of rate reviews and lower household electricity bills.\n(JEL D73, L51, L97, L98)",
