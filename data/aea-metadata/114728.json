    "description": "The EITC is intended to encourage work. But EITC-induced\nincreases in labor supply may drive wages down. I simulate the economic\nincidence of the EITC. In each scenario that I consider, a\nlarge portion of low-income single mothers' EITC payments is captured\nby employers through reduced wages. Workers who are EITC\nineligible also see wage declines. By contrast, a traditional Negative\nIncome Tax (NIT) discourages work, and so induces large transfers\nfrom employers to their workers. With my preferred parameters, $1\nin EITC spending increases after-tax incomes by $0.73, while $1\nspent on the NIT yields $1.39. (JEL H22, H23, H24, H31, J22)",
