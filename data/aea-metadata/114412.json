    "description": "This paper presents a game theoretic analysis of the generalized\nsecond-price auction that the company Overture operated in 2004\nto sell sponsored search listings on search engines. We construct a\nmodel that embodies few prior assumptions about parameters, and\nwe present results that indicate that this model has under quite general\nassumptions a multiplicity of Nash equilibria. We then analyze\nbid data assuming that advertisers choose Nash equilibrium bids. We\noffer preliminary conclusions about advertisers' true willingness to\nbid for sponsored search listings. We find that advertisers' true willingness\nto bid is multi-dimensional and decreasing in listing position.",
