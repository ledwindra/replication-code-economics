    "description": "In 1968, the Taiwanese government extended compulsory education\nfrom 6 to 9 years and opened over 150 new junior high schools at\na differential rate among regions. Within each region, we exploit\nvariations across cohorts in new junior high school openings to construct\nan instrument for schooling, and employ it to estimate the\ncausal effects of mother's or father's schooling on infant birth outcomes\nin the years 1978-1999. Parents' schooling does cause favorable\ninfant health outcomes. The increase in schooling associated\nwith the reform saved almost 1 infant life in 1,000 live births.
