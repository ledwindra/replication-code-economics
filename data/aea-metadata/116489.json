    "description": "This paper examines the impact of the Athena Scientific Women's Academic Network (SWAN) Charter on the wages and employment trajectories of female faculty.\n The Athena SWAN Charter is a gender equality initiative that formally recognizes good practice towards the representation and career progression of women in \nscience, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) through an accreditation process. We find that the gender wage gap closes after Athena \nSWAN accreditation. However, female faculty at the non-professorial level are not more likely to be promoted to professor after accreditation, or to move to an \nAthena SWAN accredited university. Taken together these results suggest that the higher wage growth experienced by female non-professorial faculty after Athena \nSWAN accreditation is likely to come from pay rises within a particular rank.",
