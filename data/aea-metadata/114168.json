    "description": "We study sources and consequences of fluctuations in the US housing\nmarket. Slow technological progress in the housing sector explains the\nupward trend in real housing prices of the last 40 years. Over the business\ncycle, housing demand and housing technology shocks explain\none-quarter each of the volatility of housing investment and housing\nprices. Monetary factors explain less than 20 percent, but have played\na bigger role in the housing cycle at the turn of the century. We show\nthat the housing market spillovers are nonnegligible, concentrated on\nconsumption rather than business investment, and have become more\nimportant over time. (JEL E23, E32, E44, O33, R31)",
