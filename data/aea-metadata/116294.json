    "description": "We utilize graphical representations of Dictator Games which generate rich individual-\nlevel data. Our baseline experiment employs budget sets over feasible\npayoff-\npairs. We test these data for consistency with utility maximization, and we\nrecover the underlying preferences for giving (trade-offs between own payoffs and\nthe payoffs of others). Two further experiments augment the analysis. An extensive\nelaboration employs three-person budget sets to distinguish preferences for giving\nfrom social preferences (trade-offs between the payoffs of others). And an intensive\nelaboration employs step-shaped sets to distinguish between behaviors that\nare compatible with well-behaved preferences and those compatible only with not\nwell-behaved cases.
