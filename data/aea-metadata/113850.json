    "description": "We estimate the development effects of electrification across Brazil\nover the period 1960-2000. We simulate a time series of hypothetical\nelectricity grids for Brazil for the period 1960-2000 that show how\nthe grid would have evolved had infrastructure investments been made based solely on geography-based cost considerations. Using the model as an instrument, we document large positive effects of electrification on development that are underestimated when one fails to account for endogenous targeting. Broad-based improvement in labor productivity across sectors and regions rather than general equilibrium re-sorting appears to be the likely mechanism by which these development gains are realized.
