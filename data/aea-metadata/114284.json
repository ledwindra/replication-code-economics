    "description": "This paper examines the consequences of rapid disinflation for\ndownward wage rigidities in two emerging countries, Brazil and\nUruguay. Although wage rigidities are altered by disinflation, in\nneither of the two countries does price stability eliminate frictions\nin wage-setting mechanisms. In a context of individual wage\nnegotiations and weak unions, disinflation in Uruguay puts an end\nto its history of indexation, but strong resistance to nominal wage\ncuts emerges. In strongly unionized Brazil, wage indexation is highly persistent, but the introduction of inflation targeting by the Central Bank in 1999 moves the focal point of wage negotiations to expected inflation.",
