    "description": "This paper demonstrates that administrative data may be inferior to\nsurvey data under particular circumstances. We examine the effect\nof state laws governing the minimum age of marriage in the United\nStates. The estimated effects of these laws are much smaller when\nbased on retrospective reports from census versus administrative\nrecords from Vital Statistics data. This discrepancy appears due\nto systematic avoidance behavior of two kinds. Some young people\nmarry in states with less restrictive laws; others appear to have misrepresented\ntheir age on their marriage certificate. Our results have\nimportant implications regarding legal avoidance and the use of\nadministrative data. (JEL J12 K36)",
