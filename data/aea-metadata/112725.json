    "description": "We develop a new methodology to estimate herd behavior in financial\nmarkets. We build a model of informational herding that can\nbe estimated with financial transaction data. In the model, rational\nherding arises because of information-event uncertainty. We estimate\nthe model using data on a NYSE stock (Ashland Inc.) during 1995.\nHerding occurs often and is particularly pervasive on some days. On\naverage, the proportion of herd buyers is 2 percent; that of herd sellers\nis 4 percent. Herding also causes important informational inefficiencies\nin the market, amounting, on average, to 4 percent of the\nasset's expected value.",
