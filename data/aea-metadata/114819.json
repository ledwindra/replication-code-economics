    "description": "This paper examines the local economic impact of Yanacocha, a large\ngold mine in Northern Peru. Using annual household data from 1997\nto 2006, we find evidence of a positive effect of the mine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for\nlocal inputs on real income. The effects are only present in the supply\nmarket and surrounding areas, and reach unskilled workers in non-mining sectors. Consistent with a general equilibrium framework,\nwe also find an increase in the local price of nontradable goods.\nTaken together, our results underline the potential of backward\nlinkages from extractive industries to create positive spillovers in\nless developed economies.
