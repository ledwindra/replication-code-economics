    "description": "When consumers or firms don't face the true social cost of their \nactions, market outcomes are inefficient. In the case of negative \nexternalities, Pigouvian taxes are one way to correct this market \nfailure, but it may be infeasible to tax the externality directly. The \nalternative, taxing a related product, will be second-best. In this \npaper, we show that in the presence of heterogeneous externalities and \nelasticities, this type of indirect tax performs poorly. In our \nempirical application, gasoline taxes to address pollution \nexternalities, less than a third of the deadweight loss of the \nexternality is addressed by second-best optimal taxes.\t\t\t\t",
