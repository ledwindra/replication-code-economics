    "description": "We report results from a randomized natural field experiment conducted in a\nrestaurant dining setting to distinguish the observational learning effect from\nthe saliency effect. We find that, when customers are given ranking information\nof the five most popular dishes, the demand for those dishes increases by 13 to\n20 percent. We do not find a significant saliency effect. We also find modest\nevidence that the observational learning effects are stronger among infrequent\ncustomers, and that dining satisfaction is increased when customers are presented\nwith the information of the top five dishes, but not when presented with\nonly names of some sample dishes.
