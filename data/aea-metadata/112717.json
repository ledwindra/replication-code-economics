    "description": "How large are optimal tariffs? What tariffs would prevail in a worldwide\ntrade war? How costly would a breakdown of international\ntrade policy cooperation be? And what is the scope for future multilateral trade negotiations? I address these and other questions\nusing a unified framework which nests traditional, new trade, and\npolitical economy motives for protection. I find that optimal tariffs\naverage 62 percent, world trade war tariffs average 63 percent, the\ngovernment welfare losses from a breakdown of international trade\npolicy cooperation average 2.9 percent, and the possible government\nwelfare gains from future multilateral trade negotiations average\n0.5 percent.
