    "description": "Prior episodes of automation have led to economic growth and also to many changes in the workplace. We expect the same from artificial intelligence (AI). The link between AI and labor is complex, however. To assist researchers and policymakers, we provide a method that links advances in AI to occupational abilities, and then aggregates from these abilities to the occupation level. We demonstrate the method by estimating which occupational descriptions have changed the most due to advances in AI between 2010 and 2015, and check our estimates using the Bureau of Labor Statistics scheduled update to occupational descriptions in 2016.",
