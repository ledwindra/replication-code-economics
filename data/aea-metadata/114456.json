    "description": "The cognitive science literature provides several research based instructional strategies (RBIS) proven to be effective in student learning. Given the prevalence of lecture-based classes and instructor-led discussions, understanding the effects of switching from the \"traditional\" method to employing RBIS would provide a better understanding of the value of these strategies. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment comparing a \"traditional,\" lecture-based class to a class in which these RBIS are carefully employed. Students exposed to the refined RBIS approach show significantly higher gains in learning of approximately 15 percentage points when compared to students in a traditional class.",
