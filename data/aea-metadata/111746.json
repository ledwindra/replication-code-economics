    "description": "This study examines male and female course persistence and choice of \neconomics degree via a combination of student, instructor, and \nstructural characteristics. We find that students of both genders who \ndeclare economics as their major are more likely to take additional \neconomics courses than their non-major peers. Additionally, students' \neconomics grades are a significant determinant of course persistence and\n degree selection, but men and women respond somewhat differently to \ntheir absolute and relative grades. Finally, men's economics degree \nselection is significantly correlated with their math abilities, while \nwomen's economics degree selection is correlated with both their math \nand verbal aptitudes.\t\t\t\t",
