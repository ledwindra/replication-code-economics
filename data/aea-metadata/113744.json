    "description": "Success in slowing obesity trends would benefit from policies aimed\nat reducing calorie consumption. In a field experiment at a fast-food\nsandwich chain, we address the effects of providing calorie information,\nmimicking recent legislation, and test an alternative approach\nthat makes ordering healthier slightly more convenient. We find that\ncalorie information reduces calorie intake. Providing a daily calorie\ntarget does as well, but only for non-overweight individuals. Making\nhealthy choices convenient reduces intake when the intervention is\nstrong. However, a milder implementation reduces sandwich calories,\nbut does not reduce total calories due to compensatory effects\non side orders and drinks. (JEL I12, I18, L81)",
