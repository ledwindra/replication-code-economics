    "description": "We study the Lagos and Wright (2005) model of monetary exchange in the laboratory.\nWith a finite population of sufficiently patient agents, this model has a unique\nmonetary equilibrium and a continuum of non-monetary gift exchange equilibria, some\nof which Pareto dominate the monetary equilibrium. We find that subjects avoid the\ngift-exchange equilibria in favor of the monetary equilibrium. We also study versions of\nthe model without money where all equilibria involve non-monetary gift-exchange. We\nfind that welfare is higher in the model with money than without money, suggesting\nthat money plays a role as an efficiency enhancing coordination device.",
