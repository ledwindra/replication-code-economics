    "description": "Bilateral tax treaties (BTTs) are intended to promote foreign direct\ninvestment through double-taxation relief. Using BEA firm-level\ndata, we find a positive effect of BTTs on FDI, which is larger for\nfirms that use differentiated inputs. BTTs allow multinational firms\nto request assistance from treaty partners' governments if they have\na grievance about how tax liabilities are determined. These provisions\ndisproportionately benefit firms that use inputs for which an\narm's-length price is difficult to observe, since allocation of earnings\nacross countries is more complex. We find differential BTT\neffects for both sales by existing affiliates and entry of new affiliates.",
