                    <dc:description>Numerous cities have enacted electronic monitoring programs at traffic
intersections in an effort to reduce the high number of vehicle accidents.
The rationale is that the higher expected fines for running a red light will
induce drivers to stop and lead to fewer cross-road collisions. However,
the cameras also incentivize drivers to accept a greater accident risk
from stopping. We evaluate the termination of a monitoring program
via a voter referendum using 12 years of geocoded police accident data.
We find that the cameras changed the composition of accidents, but no
evidence of a reduction in total accidents or injuries.&amp;nbsp;</dc:description>
