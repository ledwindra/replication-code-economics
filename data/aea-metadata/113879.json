    "description": "We use the Swedish compulsory school reform to estimate the causal\neffect of parental education on sons' outcomes. To this end, we use data\nfrom the Swedish military enlistment register on the entire population\nof males and consider outcomes, such as cognitive skills, noncognitive\nskills, and various dimensions of health at the age of 18. We find\npositive effects of maternal education on sons' skills and health status\nbut no effects of paternal education. One reason behind this result may\nbe that the fathers affected by the reform did not face any labor market\nreturns to their increased schooling.",
