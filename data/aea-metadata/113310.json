    "description": "We study the emergence of norms of cooperation in experimental economies\npopulated by strangers interacting indefinitely. Can these economies achieve\nfull efficiency even without formal enforcement institutions? Which institutions\nfor monitoring and enforcement facilitate cooperation? Finally, what classes of\nstrategies do subjects employ? We find that, first, cooperation can be sustained\neven in anonymous settings; second, some type of monitoring and punishment\ninstitutions significantly promote cooperation; and, third, subjects mostly\nemploy strategies that are selective in punishment.
