                    <dc:description>In 1968, the Taiwanese government extended compulsory education
from 6 to 9 years and opened over 150 new junior high schools at
a differential rate among regions. Within each region, we exploit
variations across cohorts in new junior high school openings to construct
an instrument for schooling, and employ it to estimate the
causal effects of mother's or father's schooling on infant birth outcomes
in the years 1978-1999. Parents' schooling does cause favorable
infant health outcomes. The increase in schooling associated
with the reform saved almost 1 infant life in 1,000 live births. (JEL
