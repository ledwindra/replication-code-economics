                    <dc:description>We develop a model of households with multiple needs (smoothing shocks, financing investment) and constraints (limited credit, self-control issues) in order to examine the nature of household's financing constraints in a developing country, and the impact of relaxing them. We show that increased access to credit has very different implications for the aggregate model economy depending on its form: asset-financed or cash. We then illustrate how a short-term increase in access to loans leads to very distinct behavior in the short run. The relevance of the model can be evaluated using a field experiment, which we are currently implementing in Uganda.</dc:description>
