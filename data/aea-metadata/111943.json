    "description": "This paper utilizes the county-by-county roll-out of China\u2019s New Rural Pension Scheme(NRPS) and finds that, among age-eligible people, the pension scheme leads to higher household income and food expenditure, less farm work, better health, and lower mortality. In addition, the NRPS shifts age-ineligible adults from farm work to non-farm work but does not significantly affect their income, expenditure, or health. No significant evidence shows that the NRPS affects private transfers or health behaviors. These findings provide relevant evidence of the impacts of social pensions on individual behaviors and welfare for developing countries today and developed countries in the past.",
