    "description": "This paper evaluates a unique RD subsidy program implemented\nin northern Italy. Firms were invited to submit proposals for new\nprojects and only those which scored above a certain threshold\nreceived the subsidy. We use a sharp regression discontinuity\ndesign to compare the investment spending of subsidized firms with\nthat of unsubsidized firms. For the sample as a whole we find no\nsignificant increase in investment. This overall effect, however, masks\nsubstantial heterogeneity in the program's impact. We estimate that\nsmall enterprises increased their investments- by approximately the\namount of the subsidy they received- whereas larger firms did not.",
