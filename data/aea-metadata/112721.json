    "description": "We investigate the relationship between violence and economic risk\npreferences in Afghanistan combining: (i) a two-part experimental\nprocedure identifying risk preferences, violations of Expected Utility,\nand specific preferences for certainty; (ii) controlled recollection of\nfear based on established methods from psychology; and (iii) administrative\nviolence data from precisely geocoded military records. We\ndocument a specific preference for certainty in violation of Expected\nUtility. The preference for certainty, which we term a Certainty\nPremium, is exacerbated by the combination of violent exposure\nand controlled fearful recollections. The results have implications\nfor risk taking and are potentially actionable for policymakers and\nmarketers.",
