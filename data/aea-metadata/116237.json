    "description": "We demonstrate the existence of multiple dimensions of private information in the\nlong-term care insurance market. Two types of people purchase insurance: individuals\nwith private information that they are high risk and individuals with private\ninformation that they have strong taste for insurance. Ex post, the former are higher\nrisk than insurance companies expect, while the latter are lower risk. In aggregate,\nthose with more insurance are not higher risk. Our results demonstrate that\ninsurance markets may suffer from asymmetric information even absent a positive\ncorrelation between insurance coverage and risk occurrence. The results also\nsuggest a general test for asymmetric information. (JEL D82, G22, I11)",
