    "description": "Set-asides and subsidies are used extensively in government procurement\nand resource sales. We analyze these policies in an empirical\nmodel of US Forest Service timber auctions. The model fits the data\nwell both within the sample of unrestricted sales used for estimation,\nand when we predict (out-of-sample) outcomes for small business\nset-asides. Our estimates suggest that restricting entry substantially\nreduces efficiency and revenue, although it increases small business\nparticipation. An alternative policy of subsidizing small bidders\nwould increase revenue and small bidder profit, with little efficiency\ncost. We explain these findings by connecting to the theory of optimal\nauction design. (JEL D44, H57, L73, Q23)",
