    "description": "This reply to Cascaldi-Garcia's (2017) comment argues that by using the original code of Kurmann and Otrok (2013) with new data on utilization-adjusted TFP, Cascaldi-Garcia (2017) confounds positive and negative news shocks. With a small modification to the code--how a news shock is signed as positive--we obtain news shock responses consistent with Sims (2016) and Kurmann and Sims (2017) and largely reestablish the results of Kurmann and Otrok (2013).",
