    "description": "Rent extraction by public sector workers may be limited by the ability\nof taxpayers to vote with their feet. But rent extraction may be higher\nin regions where high amenities mute the migration response. This\npaper develops a theoretical model that predicts such a link between\npublic sector wage differentials and local amenities, and the predictions\nare tested by analyzing variation in these differentials and\namenities across states. Public sector wage differentials are, in fact,\nlarger in the presence of high amenities, with the effect stronger for\nunionized public sector workers, whose political power may allow\ngreater scope for rent extraction.",
