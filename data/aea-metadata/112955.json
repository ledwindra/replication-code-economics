    "description": "Countercyclical risk aversion can explain major puzzles such as the\nhigh volatility of asset prices. Evidence for its existence is, however,\nscarce because of the host of factors that simultaneously change\nduring financial cycles. We circumvent these problems by priming\nfinancial professionals with either a boom or a bust scenario.\nSubjects primed with a financial bust were substantially more fearful\nand risk averse than those primed with a boom, suggesting that fear\nmay play an important role in countercyclical risk aversion. The\nmechanism described here is relevant for theory and may explain\nself-reinforcing processes that amplify market dynamics. (JEL E32,\nE44, G01, G11, G12)",
