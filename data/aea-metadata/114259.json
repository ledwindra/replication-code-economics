    "description": "We explain why international nominal bonds and equity portfolios\nare biased domestically. In our model, holding domestic government\nnominal debt provides a hedge against shocks to bond returns and\nthe impact on taxes they induce. For this result, only two features are\nessential: nominal risk and taxes only on domestic agents. A third\nfeature explains domestically biased equity holdings: government\nspending falls on domestic goods. Then, an increase in government\nspending raises the returns on domestic equity, providing a hedge\nagainst the subsequent increase in taxes. A calibrated version of the\nmodel predicts asset holdings that quantitatively match the data.\n(JEL F30, G11, G15, H61, H63)",
