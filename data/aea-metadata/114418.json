    "description": "Vendettas occur in many real-world settings where rivals compete\nfor a prize, e.g., winning a competitive promotion or retaining a job,\nby engaging in aggressive, retaliatory behavior. We present a benchmark experiment where two players have an initial probability of\nwinning a prize. Retaliatory vendettas occur and lead subjects to\nthe worst possible outcomes in 2/3 of cases, counter to self-interest\npredictions, with large inefficiencies even in the absence of any\nimmediate gain from aggression. Negative emotions are important\nand interact with the economic setting to produce large social inefficiencies. Allowing cooling off periods reduces aggression.",
