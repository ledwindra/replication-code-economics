    "description": "In the microdata underlying US trade price indexes, 40 percent of\nproducts are replaced before a single price change is observed and\n70 percent are replaced after two price changes or fewer. A price\nindex that focuses on price changes for identical items may, therefore,\nmiss an important component of price adjustment occurring\nat the time of product replacements. We provide a model of this\n\"product replacement bias\" and quantify its importance using US\ndata. Accounting for product replacement bias, long-run exchange\nrate \"pass-through\" is substantially higher than conventional estimates\nsuggest, and the terms of trade are substantially more volatile.\n(JEL F14, F31)",
