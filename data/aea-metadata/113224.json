    "description": "We conducted a natural field experiment to further our understanding of the economics\nof charity. Using direct mail solicitations to over 50,000 prior donors of a\nnonprofit organization, we tested the effectiveness of a matching grant on charitable\ngiving. We find that the match offer increases both the revenue per solicitation and\nthe response rate. Larger match ratios (i.e., $3:$1 and $2:$1) relative to a smaller\nmatch ratio ($1:$1) had no additional impact, however. The results provide avenues\nfor future empirical and theoretical work on charitable giving, cost-benefit analysis,\nand the private provision of public goods. (JEL D64, L31)",
