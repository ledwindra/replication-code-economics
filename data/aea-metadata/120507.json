    "description": "We present a framework where \u201cmodel persuaders\u201d influence receivers\u2019 beliefs by proposing models that organize past data to make predictions. Receivers are assumed to find models more compelling when they better explain the data, fixing receivers\u2019 prior beliefs. Model persuaders face a tradeoff: better-fitting models induce less movement in receivers\u2019 beliefs. Consequently, a receiver exposed to the true model can be most misled by persuasion when that model fits poorly, competition between persuaders tends to neutralize the data by pushing towards better-fitting models, and a persuader facing multiple receivers is more effective when he can send tailored, private messages.",
