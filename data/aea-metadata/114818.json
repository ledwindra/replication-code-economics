    "description": "The earned income tax credit generates large average tax refunds for\nlow-income parents, and these refunds are distributed in a narrow\ntime frame. I rely on this plausibly exogenous source of variation\nin liquidity to investigate the effect of cash on hand on unemployment\nduration. Among EITC-eligible women, unemployment spells\nbeginning just after tax refund receipt last longer than unemployment\nspells beginning at other times of year. There is no evidence that\ntax refund receipt is associated with longer unemployment duration\nfor men, or that the longer durations for women are associated with\nhigher-quality subsequent job matches.
