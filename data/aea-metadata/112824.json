    "description": "We employ data that match the population of Danish workers to the universe of\nprivate-sector Danish firms, with product-level trade flows by origin- and destination-countries.\nWe document new stylized facts about offshoring and instrument for offshoring and exporting.\nWithin job spells, offshoring increases (decreases) the high-skilled (low-skilled) wage; exporting\nincreases the wages of all skill-types; the net wage-effect of trade varies substantially within the\nsame skill-type; conditional on skill, the wage-effect of offshoring varies across task\ncharacteristics. We estimate the overall effects of offshoring on workers' present and future\nincome streams by constructing pre-offshoring-shock worker-cohorts and tracking them over\ntime.",
