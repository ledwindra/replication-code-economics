    "description": "This paper studies the relationship between civil war and the value of firms in a poor, resource-abundant\ncountry using microeconomic data for Angola. We focus on diamond mining firms and conduct an event\nstudy on the sudden end of the conflict, marked by the death of the rebel movement leader in 2002. We find\nthat the stock market perceived this event as \"bad news\" rather than \"good news\" for companies holding\nconcessions in Angola, as their abnormal returns declined by 4 percentage points. The event had no effect\non a control portfolio of otherwise similar diamond mining companies. This finding is corroborated by\nother events and by the adoption of alternative methodologies. We interpret our findings in light of\nconflict-generated entry barriers, government bargaining power, and transparency in the licensing process. (JEL D74, G32, O13, O17, Q34)",
