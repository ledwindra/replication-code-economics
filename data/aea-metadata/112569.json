    "description": "Experimentally elicited discount rates are frequently higher than what\nseems reasonable for economic decision-making. Such high rates are\noften attributed to present-biased discounting. A well-known bias of\nstandard measurements is the assumption of linear consumption utility. Attempting to correct this bias using measures of risk aversion\nto identify concavity, researchers find reasonable discounting but at\nthe cost of exceptionally high utility function curvature. We present a\nnew methodology for identifying time preferences, both discounting\nand curvature, from simple allocation decisions. We find reasonable\nlevels of both discounting and curvature and, surprisingly, dynamically\nconsistent time preferences. (JEL C91, D12, D81)",
