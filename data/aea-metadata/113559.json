    "description": "We conducted a field experiment to measure the effect of exposure\nto newspapers on political behavior and opinion. Before the 2005\nVirginia gubernatorial election, we randomly assigned individuals to\na Washington Post free subscription treatment, a Washington Times\nfree subscription treatment, or a control treatment. We find no effect\nof either paper on political knowledge, stated opinions, or turnout in\npost-election survey and voter data. However, receiving either paper\nled to more support for the Democratic candidate, suggesting that\nmedia slant mattered less in this case than media exposure. Some evidence\nfrom voting records also suggests that receiving either paper led\nto increased 2006 voter turnout. (JEL D72, L82)",
