    "description": "Personal bankruptcies in the United States have increased dramatically,\nrising from 1.4 per thousand working age adults in 1970 to\n8.5 in 2002. We use a heterogeneous agent life-cycle model with\ncompetitive lenders to evaluate several commonly offered explanations.\nWe find that increased uncertainty (income shocks, expense\nuncertainty) cannot account quantitatively for the rise in bankruptcies.\nInstead, the rise in filings appears mainly to reflect changes in\nthe credit market environment: a decrease in the transaction cost\nof lending and in the cost of bankruptcy. We also argue that the\nabolition of usury laws and other legal changes were unimportant.\n(JEL D14, E44, G21, G28)",
