    "description": "The sensitivity of US aggregate investment to shocks is procyclical.\nThe response upon impact increases by approximately 50 percent\nfrom the trough to the peak of the business cycle. This feature of\nthe data follows naturally from a DSGE model with lumpy microeconomic\ncapital adjustment. Beyond explaining this specific time\nvariation, our model and evidence provide a counterexample to the\nclaim that microeconomic investment lumpiness is inconsequential\nfor macroeconomic analysis.",
