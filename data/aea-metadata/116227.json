    "description": "This paper analyses the compensatory behavior of smokers. Exploiting data on\ncotinine concentration\u0097a metabolite of nicotine\u0097measured in a large population\nof smokers over time, we show that smokers compensate for tax hikes by extracting\nmore nicotine per cigarette. Our study makes two important contributions. First, as\nsmoking a given cigarette more intensively is detrimental to health, our results\nquestion the usefulness of tax increases. Second, we develop a model of rational\naddiction where agents can also adjust their intensity of smoking, and we show that\nthe previous empirical results suffer from estimation biases.
