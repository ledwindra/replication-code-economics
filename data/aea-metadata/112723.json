    "description": "We explore the impact of reduced transaction costs on risk sharing by\nestimating the effects of a mobile money innovation on consumption.\nIn our panel sample, adoption of the innovation increased from 43 to\n70 percent. We find that, while shocks reduce consumption by 7 percent\nfor nonusers, the consumption of user households is unaffected. The\nmechanisms underlying these consumption effects are increases in\nremittances received and the diversity of senders. We report robustness\nchecks supporting these results and use the four-fold expansion of the\nmobile money agent network as a source of exogenous variation in\naccess to the innovation.",
