    "description": "Do women and men behave differently in financial asset markets?\nOur results from an asset market experiment show a marked gender\ndifference in producing speculative price bubbles. Mixed markets\nshow intermediate values, and a meta-analysis of 35 markets from\ndifferent studies confirms the inverse relationship between the magnitude of price bubbles and the frequency of female traders in the\nmarket. Women's price forecasts also are significantly lower, even in\nthe first period. Implications for financial markets and experimental\nmethodology are discussed. (JEL D14, D81, G01, G11, J16)",
