    "description": "This paper uses a unique panel dataset of consumer financial transactions to study how consumers respond to an exogenous unanticipated income shock. Consumption rose significantly after the fiscal policy announcement: during the ten subsequent months, for each $1 received, consumers on average spent $0.80. We find a strong\nannouncement effect -- 19 percent of the response occurs during the\nfirst two-month announcement period via credit cards. Subsequently,\nconsumers switched to debit cards after disbursement before finally\nincreasing spending on credit cards in the later months. Consumers\nwith low liquid assets or with low credit card limit experienced stronger\nconsumption responses. (JEL D12, D14, E21)",
