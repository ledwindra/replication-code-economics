    "description": "Both under- and over-treatment of communicable diseases are public\nbads. But efforts to decrease one run the risk of increasing the\nother. Using rich experimental data on household treatment-\nseeking behavior in Kenya, we study the implications of this trade-off for subsidizing life-saving antimalarials sold over-the-counter at retail drug outlets. We show that a very high subsidy (such as the one under consideration by the international community) dramatically increases access, but nearly one-half of subsidized pills go to patients without malaria. We study two ways to better target subsidized drugs:\nreducing the subsidy level, and introducing rapid malaria tests\nover-the-counter. (JEL D12, D82, I12, O12, O15)",
