    "description": "We augment a standard monetary dynamic general equilibrium\nmodel to include a Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist financial accelerator\nmechanism. We fit the model to US data, allowing the volatility of\ncross-sectional idiosyncratic uncertainty to fluctuate over time. We\nrefer to this measure of volatility as risk. We find that fluctuations in\nrisk are the most important shock driving the business cycle.",
