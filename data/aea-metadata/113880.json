    "description": "This paper estimates the overall impact and externality effects of\nan influenza vaccination program expanding coverage outside the\ntypical target group. Using a triple-difference design, which exploits\nthe introduction of a broad based vaccination program in Ontario\nand the quality of the vaccine from year to year, I link higher\nvaccination to health improvements. Results indicate coverage\nexpansion leads to large excess gains for program-regions; benefits\nexhibit decreasing returns corresponding to a standard model of\ndisease dynamics; and substantial external benefits accrue to older\nadults.",
