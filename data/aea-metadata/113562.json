    "description": "We exploit a unique outlet-level dataset from a multinational chain\nwith over 2,500 outlets in 43 countries to investigate the effects of\nlabor regulations that protect employment. The dataset contains\ninformation on output, materials, and labor costs at a weekly frequency\nover several years, allowing us to examine the consequences\nof labor market rigidity at a much more detailed level than has been\npossible to date. We find that higher labor market rigidity is associated\nwith significantly higher levels of hysteresis. We also find some\nevidence that labor costs are less responsive to sales revenue in more\nhighly regulated markets. (JEL: E24, J08, J23, K31, M51)",
