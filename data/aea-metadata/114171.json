    "description": "This paper proposes a Ricardian model to understand the short-run\nand long-run aggregate effects of increased fragmentation and offshoring\non rich and poor countries. The short-run analysis shows\nthat, when offshoring is sufficiently high, further increases in offshoring\nbenefit the poor country and hurt the rich country. But these\neffects may be reversed in the long run as countries adjust their\nresearch efforts in response to increased offshoring. In particular, in\nthe long run, the rich country always gains from increased offshoring,\nwhereas poor countries see their static gains partially eroded by\na decline in their research efforts.
