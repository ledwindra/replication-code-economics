    "description": "We make use of a new data resource -- merged birth and school\nrecords for all children born in Florida from 1992 to 2002 -- to study\nthe relationship between birth weight and cognitive development.\nUsing singletons as well as twin and sibling fixed effects models,\nwe find that the effects of early health on cognitive development are\nessentially constant through the school career; that these effects are\nsimilar across a wide range of family backgrounds; and that they\nare invariant to measures of school quality. We conclude that the\neffects of early health on adult outcomes are therefore set very early.\n(JEL I12, J13, J24)",
