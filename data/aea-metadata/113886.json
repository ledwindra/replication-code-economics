    "description": "Male-female wage gaps declined significantly over the 1980s and\n1990s, while returns to education increased. In this paper, we use\ncross-city data to explore whether, like the return to education, the\nchange in the gender wage gap may reflect changes in skill prices\ninduced by the diffusion of information technology. We show that\nmale-female and education-wage differentials moved in opposite\ndirections in response to the adoption of PCs. Our most credible estimates simply that changes in skill prices driven by PC adoption can\nexplain most of the decline in the US male-female wage gap since\n1980.",
