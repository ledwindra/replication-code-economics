    "description": "We elicit traders' predictions of future price trajectories in repeated experimental\nmarkets for a 15-period-lived asset. We find that individuals' beliefs about prices are\nadaptive, and primarily based on past trends in the current and previous markets in\nwhich they have participated. Most traders do not anticipate market downturns the\nfirst time they participate in a market, and, when experienced, they typically overestimate\nthe time remaining before market peaks and downturns occur. When prices\ndeviate from fundamental values, belief data are informative to an observer in predicting\nthe direction of future price movements and the timing of market peaks.
