    "description": "Little is known about the effects of placing children who are abused or neglected into\nfoster care. This paper uses the placement tendency of child protection investigators\nas an instrumental variable to identify causal effects of foster care on long-term\noutcomes\u2014including juvenile delinquency, teen motherhood, and employment\u2014\namong children in Illinois where a rotational assignment process effectively randomizes\nfamilies to investigators. Large marginal treatment effect estimates suggest\ncaution in the interpretation, but the results suggest that children on the margin of\nplacement tend to have better outcomes when they remain at home, especially older\nchildren.
