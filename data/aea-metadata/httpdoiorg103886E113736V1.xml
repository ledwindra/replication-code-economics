                    <dc:description>Using nationally representative data files from 1970s and 1990s college
attendees, we find that in the 1970s matriculation at historically
black colleges and universities (HBCUs) was associated with
higher wages and an increased probability of graduation, relative to
attending a traditionally white institution. By the 1990s, there is a
wage penalty resulting in a 20 percent decline in the relative wages
of HBCU graduates between the two decades. There is modest support
for the possibility that the relative decline in wages associated
with HBCU matriculation is partially due to improvements in TWIs'
effectiveness at educating blacks. (JEL I23, J15, J24, J31)</dc:description>
