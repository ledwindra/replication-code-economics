    "description": "This paper studies the policy impact of civil service regulations,\nexploiting reforms undertaken by US state governments throughout\nthe twentieth century. These reforms replaced political patronage with\na civil service recruited based on merit and protected from politics.\nI find that state politicians respond to these changes by spending\nrelatively less through the reformed state-level bureaucracies.\nInstead, they allocate more funds to lower level governments. The\nreallocation of expenditures leads to reduced long-term investment\nby state governments.",
