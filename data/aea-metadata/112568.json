    "description": "This paper experimentally investigates the effects of a costly punishment option on cooperation and social welfare in long, finitely\nrepeated public good contribution games. In a perfect monitoring\nenvironment, increasing the severity of the potential punishment\nmonotonically increases average net payoffs. In a more realistic\nimperfect monitoring environment, we find a U-shaped relationship.\nAccess to a standard punishment technology in this setting significantly decreases net payoffs, even in the long run. Access to a severe punishment technology leads to roughly the same payoffs as with no punishment option, as the benefits of increased cooperation offset the social costs of punishing.
