    "description": "In this paper, we focus on the effects of surname initials on \nprofessional outcomes in the academic labor market for economists. We \nbegin our analysis with data on faculty in all top 35 U.S. economics \ndepartments. Faculty with earlier surname initials are significantly \nmore likely to receive tenure at top ten economics departments, are \nsignificantly more likely to become fellows of the Econometric Society, \nand, to a lesser extent, are more likely to receive the Clark Medal and \nthe Nobel Prize. These statistically significant differences remain the \nsame even after we control for country of origin, ethnicity, religion or\n departmental fixed effects. As a test, we replicate our analysis for \nfaculty in the top 35 U.S. psychology departments, for which \ncoauthorships are not normatively ordered alphabetically. We find no \nrelationship between alphabetical placement and tenure status in \npsychology. We suspect the \"alphabetical discrimination\" reported in \nthis paper is linked to the norm in the economics profession prescribing\n alphabetical ordering of credits on coauthored publications. We also \ninvestigate the extent to which the effects of alphabetical placement \nare internalized by potential authors in their choices to work with \ndifferent numbers of coauthors as well as in their willingness to follow\n the alphabetical ordering norm. \t\t\t\t",
