    "description": "This paper studies, theoretically and empirically, the role of overconfidence in political behavior. Our model of overconfidence in\nbeliefs predicts that overconfidence leads to ideological extremeness,\nincreased voter turnout, and stronger partisan identification.\nThe model also makes nuanced predictions about the patterns of ideology in society. These predictions are tested using unique data that\nmeasure the overconfidence and standard political characteristics of\na nationwide sample of over 3,000 adults. Our numerous predictions\nfind strong support in these data. In particular, we document that\noverconfidence is a substantively and statistically important predictor\nof ideological extremeness, voter turnout, and partisan identification.\n(JEL C83, D03, D72, D83)",
