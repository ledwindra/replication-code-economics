    "description": "Political and economic transition is often blamed for Russia's 40 percent surge in deaths between 1990 and 1994. Highlighting that increases in mortality occurred primarily among alcohol-related causes and among working-age men (the heaviest drinkers), this paper investigates an alternative explanation: the demise of the 1985-1988 Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign. Using archival\nsources to build a new oblast-year dataset spanning 1978-2000,\nwe find a variety of evidence suggesting that the campaign's end\nexplains a large share of the mortality crisis, implying that Russia's\ntransition to capitalism and democracy was not as lethal as commonly\nsuggested.
