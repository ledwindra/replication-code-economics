    "description": "Immediately following a minimum wage hike, household income\nrises on average by about $250 per quarter and spending by roughly\n$700 per quarter for households with minimum wage workers. Most\nof the spending response is caused by a small number of households\nwho purchase vehicles. Furthermore, we find that the high spending\nlevels are financed through increases in collateralized debt. Our\nresults are consistent with a model where households can borrow\nagainst durables and face costs of adjusting their durables stock.\n(JEL D12, D14, D91, J38)",
