    "description": "There is a widespread perception that externalities from troubled\nchildren are significant, though measuring them is difficult due\nto data and methodological limitations. We estimate the negative\nspillovers caused by children from troubled families by exploiting\na unique dataset in which children's school records are matched to\ndomestic violence cases. We find that children from troubled families\nsignificantly decrease the reading and math test scores of their peers\nand increase misbehavior in the classroom. The achievement spillovers\nare robust to within-family differences and when controlling\nfor school-by-year effects, providing strong evidence that neither\nselection nor common shocks are driving the results.
