    "description": "We offer evidence of gender selection within the United States.\nAnalysis of comprehensive birth data shows unusually high boy-birth\npercentages after 1980 among later children (most notably third and\nfourth children) born to Chinese and Asian Indian mothers. Based\nupon linked data from California, Asian Indian mothers are found\nto be significantly more likely to have a terminated pregnancy and to\ngive birth to a boy when they have previously only given birth to girls.\nThe observed boy-birth percentages are consistent with over 2,000\n\"missing\" Chinese and Indian girls in the United States between\n1991 and 2004.
