    "description": "India's female employment rate is one of the lowest in the world. One approach to expanding female employment is to make young women's family members more supportive of them working. We report on the effects of two interventions aimed at increasing family members' supportiveness in rural India. The first entails showing them video testimonials by working women and their family members. The second prompts a conversation between working women and their families about the benefits and challenges they face when a woman in the household works. We find no evidence that the interventions changed employment or attitudes.",
