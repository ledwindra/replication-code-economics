    "description": "Abstract: I study the aggregate implications of micro-level lumpy investment in a model consistent with the empirical dynamics of the real interest rate.nbsp; The elasticity of aggregate investment with respect to shocks is procyclical because more firms are likely to make an extensive margin investment in expansions than in recessions.nbsp; Matching the dynamics of the real interest rate is key to generating this result because it disciplines the interest-elasticity of investment and avoids counterfactual behavior of the model that would otherwise eliminate most of the procyclical responsiveness.nbsp; Therefore, data on interest rates places important discipline in aggregating micro-level investment behavior.",
