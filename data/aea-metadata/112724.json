    "description": "We estimate the sensitivity of Internet retail purchasing to sales taxes\nusing eBay data. Our first approach exploits the fact that a seller's\nlocation\u2014and therefore the applicable tax rate\u2014is revealed only\nafter a buyer has expressed interest in an item. We document how\nadverse tax \"surprises\" reduce the likelihood of purchase and shift\nsubsequent purchases toward out-of-state sellers. We then use more\naggregated data to estimate that every one percentage point increase\nin a state's sales tax increases online purchases by state residents by\nalmost 2 percent, while decreasing their online purchases from state\nretailers by 3\u20134 percent.",
