    "description": "This paper analyzes the impact of a preferential tax-price for monetary\ndonations on the joint decision to donate time (volunteer) and\nmoney. The methodological approach takes into account that consumption\nof each charitable good affects consumption of the other.\nUsing data from a national survey on household charitable giving,\nthe results show that donations of time and money are substitutes.\nHowever, a decrease in the tax-price of monetary donations also has\na positive effect on donations of time that acts outside the change in\nrelative prices. This more than offsets the substitution effect leading\nto an overall positive correlation between the two charitable goods.\n(JEL D64, H24, H31)",
