                    <dc:description>We examine the role an exogenous increase in household income,
due to a government transfer unrelated to household characteristics,
plays in children's long-run outcomes. Children in affected households
have higher levels of education in their young adulthood and
a lower incidence of criminality for minor offenses. Effects differ by
initial household poverty status. An additional $4,000 per year for
the poorest households increases educational attainment by one year
at age 21, and reduces the chances of committing a minor crime by
22 percent for 16 and 17 year olds. Our evidence suggests improved
parental quality is a likely mechanism for the change. (JEL D14,
