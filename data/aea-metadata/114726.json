    "description": "This paper documents the rise of the Internet as a source of state tax-free\ncigarettes and its impact on taxed sales elasticities. Using data\non cigarette tax rates, taxable cigarette sales and individual smoking\nrates by state from 1980 to 2005 merged with data on Internet\npenetration, this paper documents that there has been a substantial\nincrease in the sensitivity of taxable cigarette sales to state tax rates\nthat is correlated with the rise of Internet usage within states. The\nestimates imply that the increased sensitivity from cigarette smuggling\nover the Internet has lessened the revenue generating potential\nof cigarette tax increases significantly, although states are still far\nfrom the revenue-maximizing tax rates.
