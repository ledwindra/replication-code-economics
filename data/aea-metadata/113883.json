    "description": "Education ministries worldwide have promoted community engagement\nthrough school committees. This paper presents results from a\nlarge field experiment testing alternative approaches to strengthen\nschool committees in public schools in Indonesia. Two novel treatments\nfocus on institutional reforms. First, some schools were randomly\nassigned to implement elections of school committee members.\nAnother treatment facilitated joint planning meetings between the\nschool committee and the village council (linkage). Two more common\ntreatments, grants and training, provided resources to existing\nschool committees. We find that institutional reforms, in particular\nlinkage and elections combined with linkage, are most cost-effective\nat improving learning.",
