    "description": "We develop a revealed preference methodology that allows us to\nexplore whether time inconsistencies in household choice are the\nproduct of individual preference nonstationarities or the result of\nindividual heterogeneity and renegotiation within the household.\nAn empirical application to household-level microdata highlights\nthat an explicit recognition of the collective nature of household\nchoice enables the observed behavior to be rationalized by a theory\nthat assumes preference stationarity at the individual level. The\nmethodology created in this paper also facilitates the recovery of\ntheory-consistent discount rates for each individual within particular\nhousehold under study. (JEL E24, F13, F16)",
