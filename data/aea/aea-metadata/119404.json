    "description": "Through the custom of guardianship, husbands typically have the final word on their wives\u2019 labor\nsupply decisions in Saudi Arabia. We provide incentivized evidence that the vast majority of young\nmarried men in Saudi Arabia privately support women working outside the home (WWOH) from\na normative perspective, while they substantially underestimate the level of support for WWOH\nby other similar men \u2013 even men from their same social setting, such as their neighbors. We then\nshow that randomly correcting these beliefs about others increases married men\u2019s willingness to help\ntheir wives search for jobs, as measured by their costly sign-up for a job-matching service for their\nwives. Four months after the main intervention, the wives of men whose beliefs about acceptability\nof WWOH were corrected are more likely to have applied and interviewed for a job outside the\nhome. In an additional recruitment experiment with a local company, randomly informing women\nabout the actual level of support for WWOH leads them to switch from an at-home temporary\nenumerator job to a higher-paying, outside-the-home version of the job. Together, our evidence\nindicates a potentially important source of labor market frictions, where labor supply is distorted\ndue to misperceived social norms.",
