    "description": "Term premia implied by maximum likelihood estimates of affine\nterm structure models are misleading because of small-sample\nbias. We show that accounting for this bias alters the conclusions\nabout the trend, cycle, and macroeconomic determinants of the term\npremia estimated in Wright (2011). His term premium estimates are\nessentially acyclical, and often just parallel the secular trend in longterm\ninterest rates. In contrast, bias-corrected term premia show\npronounced countercyclical behavior, consistent with theoretical\nand empirical arguments about movements in risk premia.",
