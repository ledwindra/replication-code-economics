    "description": "The Israeli matriculation certificate is a prerequisite for most postsecondary\nschooling. In a randomized trial, we attempted to increase certification rates\namong low-achievers with cash incentives. The experiment used a school-based\nrandomization design offering awards to all who passed their exams in treated\nschools. This led to a substantial increase in certification rates for girls but had\nno effect on boys. Affected girls had a relatively high ex ante chance of certification.\nThe increase in girls' matriculation rates translated into an increased\nlikelihood of college attendance. Female matriculation rates increased partly\nbecause treated girls devoted extra time to exam preparation. (JEL I21, I28,\nJ16)",
