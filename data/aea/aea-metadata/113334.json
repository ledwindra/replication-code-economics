    "description": "Entrepreneurs bear substantial risk, but empirical evidence shows no sign of a\npositive premium. This paper develops a theory of endogenous entrepreneurial\nrisk taking that explains why self-financed entrepreneurs may find it optimal\nto invest in risky projects offering no risk premium. Consistently with empirical\nevidence, the model predicts that poorer entrepreneurs are more likely to\nundertake risky projects. It also finds that incentives for risk taking are stronger\nwhen agents are impatient. (JEL G31, G32, L25, L26)",
