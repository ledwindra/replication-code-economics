    "description": "There is little empirical evidence as to whether protests against policy brutality impact the behavior of police forces. We seek to close this gap by considering the impact of the racial civil disturbances in the 1960s and 1970s on deaths by legal intervention using an event study approach. In the first three years after a protest in a county, police killings of white Americans increase by 0.4\u20131.0 annually in impacted counties and killings of non-whites increase by 0.7 annually. In subsequent years, the impact on killings of white Americans disappears while the impact on killings of non-whites persists.",
