    "description": "Airline capacity utilization increased dramatically between 1993 and\n2007, after staying fairly level following deregulation. We argue that\nconsumers' use of the Internet to investigate and purchase airline\ntickets reduces market frictions and allows airlines to meet demand\nwith less capacity and higher load factors. We find that differences\nin the rate of change of metropolitan area Internet penetration are\npositively correlated with differences in the rate of change of airlines' airport-pair load factors. Consistent with our explanation, this correlation is greater on flights in more competitive markets and on flights with fewer total passengers.",
