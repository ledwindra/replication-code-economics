    "description": "Risk and time are intertwined. The present is known while the future\nis inherently risky. This is problematic when studying time preferences\nsince uncontrolled risk can generate apparently present-biased\nbehavior. We systematically manipulate risk in an intertemporal\nchoice experiment. Discounted expected utility performs well with\nrisk, but when certainty is added common ratio predictions fail\nsharply. The data cannot be explained by prospect theory, hyperbolic\ndiscounting, or preferences for resolution of uncertainty, but seem\nconsistent with a direct preference for certainty. The data suggest\nstrongly a difference between risk and time preferences. (JEL C91\nD81 D91)",
