    "description": "Recent evidence suggests consumers pay less attention to commodity\ntaxes levied at the register than to taxes included in a good's posted\nprice. If this attention gap is larger for high-income consumers than\nfor low-income consumers, policymakers can manipulate a tax's\nregressivity by altering the fraction of the tax imposed at the register.\nWe investigate income differences in attentiveness to cigarette taxes,\nexploiting state and time variation in cigarette excise and sales\ntax rates. Whereas all consumers respond to taxes that appear in\ncigarettes' posted price, our results suggest that only low-income\nconsumers respond to taxes levied at the register.
