    "description": "Using the most comprehensive developing country dataset ever\ncompiled on air and water pollution and environmental regulations,\nthe paper assesses India's environmental regulations with a\ndifference-in-differences design. The air pollution regulations are\nassociated with substantial improvements in air quality. The most\nsuccessful air regulation resulted in a modest but statistically\ninsignificant decline in infant mortality. In contrast, the water\nregulations had no measurable benefits. The available evidence leads\nus to cautiously conclude that higher demand for air quality prompted\nthe effective enforcement of air pollution regulations, indicating that\nstrong public support allows environmental regulations to succeed in\nweak institutional settings.",
