    "description": "Many individuals' choices and valuations involve a degree of uncertainty/imprecision.\nThis paper reports an experiment designed to obtain some measure of\nimprecision and to examine the extent to which it can explain preference reversals\nof two opposite forms, one of which appears not to have been reported previously.\nThe model of imprecision we examine not only predicts both patterns but also\nprovides an account of earlier results that are otherwise not well explained. The\nresults suggest that any successful descriptive theory of choice and valuation will\nneed to allow in some way for the imprecision surrounding people's decisions. (JEL\nC91, D11, D81)",
