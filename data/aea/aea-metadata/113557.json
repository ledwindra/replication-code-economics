    "description": "This paper applies principles from evolutionary biology to the study\nof unions. We show that unions that implement the preferred wage\nand organizing policies of workers will be displaced in evolutionary\ncompetition by unions that either extract less from firms, allowing\nthem to live longer, or spend more on union organizing, or both.\nThis implies that unions with constitutional incumbency advantages\nthat allow leaders to depart from members' preferences may have a\nselective advantage, allowing them to grow at the expense of unions\nlacking such provisions. Evidence from the history of American\nunions supports these predictions. (JEL A12, J51)",
