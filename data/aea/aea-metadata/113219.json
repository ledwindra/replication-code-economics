    "description": "In developing countries lacking legal enforcement, villagers may use implicit contracts\nto minimize crime. I construct a dynamic limited-commitment model, in which\na thief cannot commit to forego stealing, but is induced to steal less by the promise of\nfuture gifts. Combining survey data on production, theft, gifts, and trust with experiments\nmeasuring trustworthiness, I provide supporting evidence. Farmers living near\nmore relatives or with plots that are difficult to steal from give fewer gifts and trust\nmore, and those living near more relatives also experience less theft. Giving increases\nwhen trust is lower and the threat of theft is greater. (JEL D86, K42, O17, Z13)",
