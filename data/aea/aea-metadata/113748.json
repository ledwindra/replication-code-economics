    "description": "In this paper, we demonstrate that, in a context where peer groups\ndo not overlap fully, it is possible to identify all the relevant parameters\nof the standard linear-in-means model of social interactions.\nWe apply this novel identification structure to study peer effects in\nthe choice of college major. Results show that one is more likely\nto choose a major when many of her peers make the same choice.\nWe also show that peers can divert students from majors in which\nthey have a relative ability advantage, with adverse consequences\non academic performance, entry wages, and job satisfaction.
