    "description": "This paper presents an assignment model of CEOs and firms. The distributions\nof CEO pay levels and firms' market values are analyzed as the competitive\nequilibrium of a matching market where talents, as well as CEO positions,\nare scarce. It is shown how the observed joint distribution of CEO pay and\nmarket value can then be used to infer the economic value of underlying\nability differences. The variation in CEO pay is found to be mostly due\nto variation in firm characteristics, whereas implied differences in\nmanagerial ability are small and make relatively little difference to\nshareholder value.",
