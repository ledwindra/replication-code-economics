    "description": "This paper presents a new model of Bertrand competition between heterogeneous firms in the open economy where the macroeconomic distribution of markups responds to the degree of trade openness and the underlying level of technology in each trading partner. The model's simple closed-form distributions for markups and pricing yield predictions that coincide with a number of stylized facts from the empirical literature on markups, pass-through, and trade openness which previously could be illustrated only through numerical simulations.
