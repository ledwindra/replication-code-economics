    "description": "With newly available data, I investigate to what extent countries'\ninternational trade exploits the very uneven water resources on a\nglobal scale. I find that water is a source of comparative advantage\nand that relatively water abundant countries export more water-intensive products. Additionally, water contributes significantly less to the pattern of exports than the traditional production factors labor and physical capital. This suggests relatively moderate disruptions\nto overall trade on a global scale due to changing precipitation in\nthe wake of climate change.",
