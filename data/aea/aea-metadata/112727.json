    "description": "Some researchers have argued that anchoring in economic valuations\ncasts doubt on the assumption of consistent and stable preferences. We\npresent new evidence that explores the strength of certain anchoring\nresults. We then present a theoretical framework that provides insights\ninto why we should be cautious of initial empirical findings in general.\nThe model importantly highlights that the rate of false positives\ndepends not only on the observed significance level, but also on statistical\npower, research priors, and the number of scholars exploring\nthe question. Importantly, a few independent replications dramatically\nincrease the chances that the original finding is true.",
