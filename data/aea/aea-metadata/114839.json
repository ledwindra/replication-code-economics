    "description": "We document large long-run differences in average house price\nappreciation across metropolitan areas over the past 50 years, and\nshow they can be explained by an inelastic supply of land in some\nunique locations combined with an increasing number of highincome\nhouseholds nationally. The resulting high house prices and\nprice-to-rent ratios in those \"superstar\" areas crowd out lower\nincome households. The same forces generate a similar pattern\namong municipalities within a metropolitan area. These facts suggest\nthat disparate local house price and income trends can be driven by\naggregate demand, not just changes in local factors such as productivity\nor amenities.",
