    "description": "Some individuals borrow extensively on their credit cards. This\npaper tests whether present-biased time preferences correlate with\ncredit card borrowing. In a field study, we elicit individual time preferences\nwith incentivized choice experiments, and match resulting\ntime preference measures to individual credit reports and annual\ntax returns. The results indicate that present-biased individuals are\nmore likely to have credit card debt, and to have significantly higher\namounts of credit card debt, controlling for disposable income, other\nsocio-demographics, and credit constraints.
