    "description": "Efficient targeting of public programs is difficult when the cost or\nbenefit to potential recipients is private information. This study\nillustrates the potential of self-selection to improve allocational\noutcomes in the context of a program that subsidizes tree planting\nin Malawi. Landholders who received a tree planting contract as a\nresult of bidding in an auction kept significantly more trees alive over\na three year period than did landholders who received the contract\nthrough a lottery. The gains from targeting on private information\nthrough the auction represent a 30 percent cost savings per surviving\ntree for the implementing organization.",
