    "description": "The design of the New York City (NYC) high school match involved trade-offs\namong efficiency, stability, and strategy-proofness that raise new theoretical\nquestions. We analyze a model with indifferences -- ties -- in school preferences.\nSimulations with field data and the theory favor breaking indifferences\nthe same way at every school -- single tiebreaking -- in a student-proposing\ndeferred acceptance mechanism. Any inefficiency associated with a realized\ntiebreaking cannot be removed without harming student incentives. Finally,\nwe empirically document the extent of potential efficiency loss associated with\nstrategy-proofness and stability, and direct attention to some open questions.\n(JEL C78, D82, I21)",
