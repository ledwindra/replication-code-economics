    "description": "Prior studies suggest that with elastically supplied inputs free entry\nmay lead to an inefficiently high number of firms in equilibrium.\nUnder input scarcity, however, the welfare loss from free entry is\nreduced. Further, free entry may increase use of high-quality inputs,\nas oligopolistic firms underuse these inputs when entry is constrained.\nWe assess these predictions by examining how the 1996\nrepeal of certificate-of-need (CON ) legislation in Pennsylvania\naffected the market for cardiac surgery in the state. We show that\nentry led to a redistribution of surgeries to higher quality surgeons,\nand that this entry was approximately welfare neutral. (JEL I11, L13)",
