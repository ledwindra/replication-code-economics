    "description": "This paper examines empirically how international taxation\naffects the volume and pricing of cross-border banking activities\nfor a sample of banks in 38 countries over the 1998\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd2008 period.\nInternational double taxation of foreign-source bank income is found\nto reduce banking-sector FDI. Furthermore, such taxation is almost\nfully passed on into higher interest margins charged abroad. These\nresults imply that international double taxation distorts the activities\nof international banks, and that the incidence of international double\ntaxation of banks is on bank customers in the foreign subsidiary\ncountry.",
