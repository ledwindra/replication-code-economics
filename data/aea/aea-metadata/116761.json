    "description": "The Green Revolution, which\nbolstered agricultural yields and economic rural well-being in Asia and Latin\nAmerica beginning in the 1960s, but largely bypassed sub-Saharan\nAfrica. We study the first randomized controlled trial of a\ngovernment-implemented input subsidy program (ISP) in Africa.\nWe find that this A temporary subsidy for Mozambican maize\nfarmers stimulates Green Revolution technology adoption and leads to increased\nmaize yields. Effects of the subsidy persist in later unsubsidized years. In\naddition, social networks of subsidized farmers benefit from spillovers, experiencing\nincreases in technology adoption, yields, and beliefs about the returns to the\ntechnologies. Spillovers account for the vast majority of subsidy-induced\ngains. ISPs alleviate informational market failures, stimulating learning about\nnew technologies by subsidy recipients and their social networks.",
