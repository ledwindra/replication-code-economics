    "description": "New ideas, products, and practices take time to diffuse, a fact that is often\nattributed to some form of heterogeneity among potential adopters. This paper\nexamines three broad classes of diffusion models -- contagion, social influence,\nand social learning -- and shows how to incorporate heterogeneity into\neach at a high level of generality without losing analytical tractability. Each\ntype of model leaves a characteristic \"footprint\" on the shape of the adoption\ncurve which provides a basis for discriminating empirically between them. The\napproach is illustrated using the classic study of Ryan and Gross (1943) on the\ndiffusion of hybrid corn. (JEL D83, O33, Q16, Z13)",
