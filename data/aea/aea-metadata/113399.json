    "description": "We use a variant of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to examine\nindividuals' implicit attitudes towards various ethnic groups. Using\na population from the Democratic Republic of Congo, we find that the\nIAT measures show evidence of an implicit bias in favor of one's own\nethnicity. Individuals have implicit views of their own ethnic group\nthat are more positive than their implicit views of other ethnic\ngroups. We find this implicit bias to be quantitatively smaller than\nthe (explicit) bias one finds when using self-reported attitudes\nabout different ethnic groups.",
