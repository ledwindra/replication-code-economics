    "description": "I elicit causal effects of spousal observability and communication on financial\nchoices of married individuals in the Philippines. When choices are private,\nmen put money into their personal accounts. When choices are observable,\nmen commit money to consumption for their own benefit. When required to\ncommunicate, men put money into their wives' account. These strong treatment\neffects on men, but not women, appear related more to control than to gender:\nmen whose wives control household savings respond more strongly to the treatment\nand women whose husbands control savings exhibit the same response.\nChanges in information and communication interact with underlying control to\nproduce mutable gender-specific outcomes.
