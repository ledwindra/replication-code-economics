    "description": "We present a model in which investment in schooling generates two kinds of\nreturns: the labor-market return, resulting from higher wages, and a marriage-market\nreturn, defined as the impact of schooling on the marital surplus share\none can extract. Men and women may have different incentives to invest in\nschooling because of different market wages or household roles. This asymmetry\ncan yield a mixed equilibrium with some educated individuals marrying\nuneducated spouses. When the labor-market return to schooling rises, home\nproduction demands less time, and the traditional spousal labor division norms\nweaken, more women may invest in schooling than men.
