    "description": "This paper presents a model of business cycles driven by shocks to consumer\nexpectations regarding aggregate productivity. Agents are hit by heterogeneous\nproductivity shocks, they observe their own productivity and a noisy public\nsignal regarding aggregate productivity. The public signal gives rise to \"noise\nshocks,\" which have the features of aggregate demand shocks: they increase\noutput, employment, and inflation in the short run and have no effects in the\nlong run. Numerical examples suggest that the model can generate sizable\namounts of noise-driven volatility. (JEL D83, D84, E21, E23, E32)",
