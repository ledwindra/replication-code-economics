    "description": "We document three remarkable features of the Opower program, in\nwhich social comparison-based home energy reports are repeatedly\nmailed to more than six million households nationwide. First, initial\nreports cause high-frequency \"action and backsliding,\"  but these\ncycles attenuate over time. Second, if reports are discontinued after\ntwo years, effects are relatively persistent, decaying at 10-20 percent\nper year. Third, consumers are slow to habituate: they continue to\nrespond to repeated treatment even after two years. We show that the\nprevious conservative assumptions about post-intervention persistence had dramatically understated cost effectiveness and illustrate how empirical estimates can optimize program design.",
