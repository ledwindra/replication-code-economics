    "description": "This paper uses a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)\nmodel with sticky information as a laboratory to study monetary\npolicy. It characterizes the model's predictions for macro dynamics\nand optimal policy at prior parameters, and then uses data on\nfive US macroeconomic series to update the parameters and provide\nan estimated model that can be used for policy analysis. The\nmodel answers a few policy questions. How does sticky information\naffect optimal monetary policy? What is the optimal interest rate\nrule? What is the optimal elastic price-level targeting rule? How\ndoes parameter uncertainty affect optimal policy? Are the conclusions\nfor the Euro area different? (JEL E13, E31, E43, E52)",
