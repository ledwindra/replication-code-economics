    "description": "This paper employs an empirically estimated model to study the equilibrium effects of an increase in the US corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. I identify and model heterogeneity across\nfirms and find that the profit impacts of CAFE fall almost entirely on\ndomestic producers. The welfare analyses consider the simultaneous\nhousehold decision of vehicle and miles traveled, allowing direct\ncomparison with a gasoline tax. Finally, I consider dynamic impacts\nin the used car market. I find these comprise nearly half the gross\nwelfare cost of CAFE and fall disproportionately on low-income\nhouseholds. Contrary to previous results, the overall welfare costs\nare regressive. (JEL H24, L51, L62)",
