    "description": "People exhibit peer-induced fairness concerns when they look to their peers as\na reference to evaluate their endowments. We analyze two independent ultimatum\ngames played sequentially by a leader and two followers. With peer-induced\nfairness, the second follower is averse to receiving less than the first\nfollower. Using laboratory experimental data, we estimate that peer-induced\nfairness between followers is two times stronger than distributional fairness\nbetween leader and follower. Allowing for heterogeneity, we find that 50 percent\nof subjects are fairness-minded. We discuss how peer-induced fairness\nmight limit price discrimination, account for low variability in CEO compensation,\nand explain pattern bargaining. (JEL C72, D63 )",
