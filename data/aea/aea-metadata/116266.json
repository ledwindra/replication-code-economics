    "description": "Aggregate consumption growth risk explains why low interest rate currencies do not\nappreciate as much as the interest rate differential and why high interest rate\ncurrencies do not depreciate as much as the interest rate differential. Domestic\ninvestors earn negative excess returns on low interest rate currency portfolios and\npositive excess returns on high interest rate currency portfolios. Because high\ninterest rate currencies depreciate on average when domestic consumption growth\nis low and low interest rate currencies appreciate under the same conditions, low\ninterest rate currencies provide domestic investors with a hedge against domestic\naggregate consumption growth risk.
