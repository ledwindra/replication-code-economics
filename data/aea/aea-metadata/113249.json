    "description": "The intertemporal elasticity of investment for long-lived capital goods is\nnearly infinite. Consequently, investment prices should fully reflect\ntemporary tax subsidies, regardless of the investment supply elasticity.\nSince prices move one-for-one with the subsidy, elasticities can be\ninferred from quantities alone. This paper uses a recent tax policy--bonus\ndepreciation--to estimate the investment supply elasticity. Investment in\nqualified capital increased sharply. The estimated elasticity is\nhigh--between 6 and 14. There is no evidence that market prices reacted to\nthe subsidy, suggesting that adjustment costs are internal, or that\nmeasurement error masks the price changes.",
