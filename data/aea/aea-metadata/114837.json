    "description": "Production subsidies for renewable energy, such as solar or wind\npower, are rationalized by their environmental benefits. Subsidizing\nthese projects allows clean, renewable technologies to produce\nelectricity that otherwise would have been produced by dirtier,\nfossil-fuel power plants. In this paper, I quantify the emissions\noffset by wind power for a large electricity grid in Texas using the\nrandomness inherent in wind power availability. When accounting\nfor dynamics in the production process, the results indicate that only\nfor high estimates of the social costs of pollution does the value of\nemissions offset by wind power exceed cost of renewable energy\nsubsidies.",
