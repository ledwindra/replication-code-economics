    "description": "Stem cell transplants save lives of many patients with blood diseases. Donation\nis painful, but rarely has lasting adverse effects. Patients can accept transplants\nonly from donors with compatible immune systems. Those lacking a sibling\nmatch must seek donations from the general population. The probability that\ntwo unrelated persons are compatible is less than 1/10,000. Health authorities\nmaintain a registry of several million genetically tested potential donors who\nagree to donate if asked. We find that the benefits of adding registrants of every\nrace exceed costs. We also explore the peculiar structure of voluntary public\ngood provision that faces potential donors.
