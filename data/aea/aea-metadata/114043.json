    "description": "We develop comprehensive measures of time spent in market work,\nhome production, schooling, and leisure in the United States for the\nlast 106 years. We find that hours of work for prime age individuals\nare essentially unchanged, with the rise in women's hours fully compensating\nfor the decline in men's hours. Hours worked by those 14\nto 24 years old have declined noticeably, but most of this decline was\noffset by a rise in hours spent in school. Overall, per capita leisure\nand average annual lifetime leisure increased by only four or five\nhours per week during the last 100 years. (JEL D13, J16, J22)",
