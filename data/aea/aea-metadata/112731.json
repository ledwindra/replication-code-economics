    "description": "This paper analyzes long-term effects of skilled-worker immigration\non productivity for the Huguenot migration to Prussia. In 1685,\nreligiously persecuted French Huguenots settled in Brandenburg-\nPrussia and compensated for population losses due to plagues during\nthe Thirty Years' War. We combine Huguenot immigration lists from\n1700 with Prussian firm-level data on the value of inputs and outputs\nin 1802 in a unique database to analyze the effects of skilled immigration\nto places with underused economic potential. Exploiting this\nsettlement pattern in an instrumental-variable approach, we find substantial\nlong-term effects of Huguenot settlement on the productivity\nof textile manufactories.",
