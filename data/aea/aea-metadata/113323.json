    "description": "We show that any decision maker who \"narrowly brackets\" (evaluates decisions\nseparately) and does not have constant-absolute-risk-averse preferences\nwill make a first-order stochastically dominated combined choice in some\nsimple pair of independent binary decisions. We also characterize the preference-contingent monetary cost from this mistake. Empirically, in a real-stakes\nlaboratory experiment that replicates Tversky and Kahneman's (1981) experiment,\n28 percent of participants choose dominated combinations. In a representative\nsurvey eliciting hypothetical large-stakes choices, higher proportions\ndo so. Violation rates vary little with personal characteristics. Average preferences\nare prospect-theoretic, with an estimated 89 percent of people bracketing\nnarrowly.\n(JEL D12, D81)",
