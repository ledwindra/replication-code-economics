    "description": "We document the evolution of productivity in a steel mini mill with fixed\ncapital, producing an unchanged product with Leontief technology\nworking 24/7. Despite\u2014almost\u2014unchanged production conditions,\noutput doubled within the sample period (12 years). We decompose the\ngains into downtime reductions, more rounds of production per time,\nand more output per run. After attributing productivity gains to investment\nand an incentive plan, we are left with a large unexplained component.\nLearning by experimentation, or tweaking, seems to be behind\nthe continual and gradual process of productivity growth. The findings\nsuggest that capacity is not well defined, even in batch-oriented manufacturing.",
