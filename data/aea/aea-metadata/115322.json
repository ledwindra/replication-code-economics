    "description": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis paper conducts a stated-choice experiment where respondents are asked to rate various\ninsurance products aimed to protect against financial risks associated with long-term care needs.\nUsing exogenous variation in prices from the survey design and individual cost estimates, these\nstated-choice probabilities are used to predict market equilibrium for long-term care insurance.\nOur results are twofold. First, information frictions are pervasive. Second, measuring the welfare\nlosses associated with frictions in a framework that also allows for selection, it is found that\ninformation frictions reduce equilibrium take-up and lead to large welfare losses while selection\nplays little role.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
