    "description": "Most nonelderly Americans purchase health insurance through\ntheir employers, which sponsor a limited number of plans. Using\na panel dataset representing over ten million insured lives, we estimate employees' preferences for different health plans and use the\nestimates to predict their choices if more plans were made available\nto them on the same terms, i.e., with equivalent subsidies and at\nlarge-group prices. Using conservative assumptions, we estimate a\nmedian welfare gain of 13 percent of premiums. A proper accounting\nof the costs and benefits of a transition from employer-sponsored\nto individually-purchased insurance should include this nontrivial\ngain. (JEL G22, I13, J32)",
