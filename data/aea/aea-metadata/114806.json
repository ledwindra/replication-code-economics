    "description": "We use Oportunidades, a conditional cash transfer to women, to\nshow that standard demand models do not represent the sample's\nbehavior: Oportunidades increases eligible households' food budget\nshares, despite food being a necessity; demand for food and high-protein food changes over time only in treatment areas; the treatment effects on food and high-protein food consumption are larger than the prediction from the Engel curves at baseline; and the curves do not change in eligible households with high baseline bargaining power for the transfer recipient. Thus, handing transfers to women is a likely determinant of the observed nutritional changes. (JEL D12, H23, J16, O12)",
