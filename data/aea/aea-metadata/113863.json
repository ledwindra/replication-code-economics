    "description": "This paper considers the role of marriage in improving labor market\noutcomes through the expansion of an individual's networks. I focus\non the impact of the relationship with the father-in-law on a young\nman's career using panel data from China. The identification strategy\nisolates the network effects related to a man's father-in-law by examining\nthe post-marriage death of a father-in-law. The estimates suggest\nthat the loss of the father-in-law translates into a decrease in a man's\nearnings of 7 percent.",
