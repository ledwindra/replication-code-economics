    "description": "We provide a simple quantitative general equilibrium model of occupational choice with credit market frictions to analyze the aggregate and distributional effects of asset transfer programs. Asset transfer programs have a positive but transient effect on aggregate productivity, and a negative impact on the aggregate capital stock. On net they have a negative but small effect on per capita income. The effects are very heterogeneous across treated individuals. We compare the results in our model to those from recent randomized control trials and historical natural experiments.",
