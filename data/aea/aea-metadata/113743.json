    "description": "This paper studies the contribution of sulfa drugs, a groundbreaking\nmedical innovation in the 1930s, to declines in US mortality. For\nseveral infectious diseases, sulfa drugs represented the first effective\ntreatment. Using time-series and difference-in-differences methods,\nwe find that sulfa drugs led to a 24 to 36 percent decline in maternal\nmortality, 17 to 32 percent decline in pneumonia mortality, and 52\nto 65 percent decline in scarlet fever mortality between 1937 and\n1943. Altogether, sulfa drugs reduced mortality by 2 to 3 percent and\nincreased life expectancy by 0.4 to 0.7 years. We also find that sulfa\ndrugs benefited whites more than blacks.
