    "description": "The cornerstone of cartel enforcement in the United States and elsewhere is a\ncommitment to the lenient prosecution of early confessors. A burgeoning gametheoretical\nliterature is ambiguous regarding the impacts of leniency. I develop\na theoretical model of cartel behavior that provides empirical predictions and\nmoment conditions, and apply the model to the complete set of indictments and\ninformation reports issued over a 20-year span. Statistical tests are consistent\nwith the notion that leniency enhances deterrence and detection capabilities.\nThe results have implications for market efficiency and enforcement efforts\nagainst cartels and other forms of organized crime.
