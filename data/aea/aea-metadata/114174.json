    "description": "Countries that trade more with each other exhibit higher business\ncycle correlation. This paper examines the mechanisms underlying\nthis relationship using a large cross-country, industry-level panel\ndataset of manufacturing production and trade. We show that sector\npairs that experience more bilateral trade exhibit stronger comovement.\nVertical linkages in production are an important explanation\nbehind this effect: bilateral international trade increases comovement\nsignificantly more in cross-border industry pairs that use each other\nas intermediate inputs. Our estimates imply that these vertical production\nlinkages account for some 30 percent of the total impact of\nbilateral trade on the business cycle correlation. (JEL E32, F14, F43)",
