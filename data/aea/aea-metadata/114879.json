    "description": "This paper evaluates a large-scale appliance replacement program\nin Mexico that from 2009 to 2012 helped 1.9 million households\nreplace their old refrigerators and air conditioners with energyefficient\nmodels. Using household-level billing records from the universe of Mexican residential customers, we find that refrigerator replacement reduces electricity consumption by 8 percent, about one-quarter of what was predicted by ex ante analyses. Moreover, we find that air conditioning replacement actually increases electricity consumption. Overall, we find that the program is an expensive way to reduce externalities from energy use, reducing carbon dioxide emissions at a program cost of over $500 per ton.",
