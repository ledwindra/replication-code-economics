    "description": "The largest twentieth-century increase in US home ownership\noccurred between 1940 and 1960, associated largely with declining\nage at first ownership. I shed light on the contribution of coincident\ngovernment mortgage market interventions by examining home\nloan benefits granted under the World War II and Korean War GI\nBills. Veterans' benefits increased home ownership rates primarily by\nshifting purchase earlier in life, explaining 7.4 percent of the overall\n1940-1960 increase, and 25 percent of the increase for affected\ncohorts. A rough extrapolation suggests that broader changes in\nmortgage terms can explain 40 percent of the 1940-1960 increase.\n(JEL G21, N22, N92, R21, R31)",
