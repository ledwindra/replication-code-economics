    "description": "We examine how cross-border input linkages shape the response of demand for value added to international relative price changes. We define a novel value-added real effective exchange rate (REER), which aggregates bilateral value-added price changes. Spillovers via input linkages lower the sensitivity of the value-added REER to price changes by supply chain partners because they counterbalance demand-side expenditure switching. Input linkages also raise the price elasticity of demand relative to the conventional REER framework, making demand more sensitive to REER changes. Using global input-output data, we demonstrate that these conceptual insights are quantitatively important in a case study of European competitiveness.",
