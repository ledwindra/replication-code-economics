    "description": "Fear of risk provides a rationale for protracted economic downturns.\nWe develop a real business cycle model where investors with decreasing\nrelative risk aversion choose between a risky and a safe technology\nthat exhibit decreasing returns. Because of a feedback effect\nfrom the interest rate to risk aversion, two equilibria can emerge: a\nstandard equilibrium and a \"safe\" one in which investors invest in\nsafer assets. We refer to the dynamics of this second equilibrium as\na safety trap because it is self-reinforcing as investors accumulate\nmore wealth and show it to be consistent with Japan's lost decade.",
