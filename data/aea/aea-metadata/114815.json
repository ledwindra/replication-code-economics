    "description": "The early work of Stigler (1971) treats the regulatory process as the\narbitration of conflicting economic and political interests rather than\na pure welfare-maximizing effort. This paper builds on these ideas\nand models the regulatory process as a game where the industry-lobby, consumers-voters, and a regulator-politician interact to define the regulated price, in alternating electoral and non-electoral periods. The equilibrium that emerges consists of a fully rational political price cycle in a regulated industry. Using monthly data for regulated gasoline and electricity prices from Brazil, we find strong evidence pointing towards the existence of electoral price cycles in both markets.
