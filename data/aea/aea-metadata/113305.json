    "description": "This paper presents a model in which price setting firms decide what to pay\nattention to, subject to a constraint on information flow. When idiosyncratic\nconditions are more variable or more important than aggregate conditions,\nfirms pay more attention to idiosyncratic conditions than to aggregate conditions.\nWhen we calibrate the model to match the large average absolute size of\nprice changes observed in micro data, prices react fast and by large amounts to\nidiosyncratic shocks, but only slowly and by small amounts to nominal shocks.\nNominal shocks have strong and persistent real effects.
