    "description": "We study whether transfer programs in which funds are targeted to\nwomen decrease the incidence of spousal abuse. We examine the\nimpact of the Mexican Oportunidades program on spousal abuse\nrates and threats of violence using data from a specialized survey.\nBeneficiary women are 40 percent less likely to be victims of physical\nabuse, but are more likely to receive violent threats with no associated\nabuse. This evidence is consistent with a model of decision-makers'\ninteractions with asymmetric information in the male partner's gains\nto marriage, who can then use threats of violence to extract rents\nfrom their female partners.
