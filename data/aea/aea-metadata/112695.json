    "description": "According to standard macroeconomic models, the zero lower bound\ngreatly reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy and increases the\nefficacy of fiscal policy. However, private-sector decisions depend\non the entire path of expected future short-term interest rates, not\njust the current short-term rate. Put differently, longer-term yields\nmatter. We show how to measure the zero bound's effects on yields\nof any maturity. Indeed, 1- and 2-year Treasury yields were surprisingly unconstrained throughout 2008 to 2010, suggesting that monetary and fiscal policy were about as effective as usual during this\nperiod. Only beginning in late 2011 did these yields become more\nconstrained.",
