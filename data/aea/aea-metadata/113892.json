    "description": "This paper studies the economic effects of endorsements. In the\npublishing sector, endorsements are found to be a business stealing\nform of advertising that raises title level sales without expanding\nthe market size. If anything, the endorsements decrease aggregate\nadult fiction sales. This might be a result of the endorsed books\nbeing more difficult than those that otherwise would have been purchased. Economically meaningful sales increases are also found\nfor nonendorsed titles written by endorsed authors. This spillover\ndemand demonstrates the broad range of benefits of advertising for\nfirms operating in a multiproduct brand setting.",
