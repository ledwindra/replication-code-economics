    "description": "Comparing US states that implemented policies generating state-specific variation in the take-up rate for food stamps, I find that food stamp eligible households experienced lower inflation and a faster increase in product variety in states with a larger increase in take-up (i.e., with increasing demand from the eligible population). Consistent with a causal interpretation, the effects are driven by food products with strong local brands and there is no comparable pattern for ineligible households across the income distribution. Thus, the long-run supply response to changes in demand from food stamp recipients has a first-order impact on the program's cost-benefit analysis.",
