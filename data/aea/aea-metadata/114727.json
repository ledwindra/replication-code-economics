    "description": "Should the income tax include a credit for short taxpayers and a\nsurcharge for tall ones? The standard utilitarian framework for tax\nanalysis answers this question in the affirmative. Moreover, a plausible\nparameterization using data on height and wages implies a substantial\nheight tax: a tall person earning $50,000 should pay $4,500\nmore in tax than a short person. One interpretation is that personal\nattributes correlated with wages should be considered more widely\nfor determining taxes. Alternatively, if policies such as a height tax\nare rejected, then the standard utilitarian framework must fail to\ncapture intuitive notions of distributive justice.
