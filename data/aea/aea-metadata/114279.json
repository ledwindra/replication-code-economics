    "description": "This paper examines issues related to the estimation of the government\nspending multiplier (GSM) in a DSGE context. We stress a\nsource of bias in the GSM arising from the combination of endogenous\ngovernment expenditures and Edgeworth complementarity\nbetween private consumption and government expenditures. Due to\ncross-equation restrictions, omitting the endogenous component of\ngovernment policy at the estimation stage would lead an econometrician\nto underestimate the degree of Edgeworth complementarity and,\nconsequently, the long-run GSM. An estimated version of our model\nwith US postwar data shows that this bias matters quantitatively. The\nresults are robust to a number of perturbations.",
