    "description": "We document and analyze the emergence of a substantial gender gap\nin mathematics in the early years of schooling using a large, recent,\nand nationally representative panel of US children. There are no\nmean differences between boys and girls upon entry to school, but\ngirls lose more than two-tenths of a standard deviation relative to\nboys over the first six years of school. The ground lost by girls relative\nto boys is roughly half as large as the black-white test score gap\nthat appears over these same ages. We document the presence of this\ngender math gap across every strata of society. We explore a wide\nrange of possible explanations in the data, including less investment\nby girls in math, low parental expectations, and biased tests, but\nfind little support for these theories. Moving to cross-country comparisons,\nwe find earlier results linking the gender gap in math to\nmeasures of gender equality are sensitive to the inclusion of Muslim\ncountries, where, in spite of women's low status, there is little or no\ngender gap in math.
