    "description": "This paper studies the effect of exchange rate shocks on export\nbehavior of multi-product firms. We provide a theoretical framework\nillustrating how firms adjust their prices, quantities, product scope,\nand sales distribution across products in the event of exchange rate\nfluctuations. In response to a real exchange rate depreciation, firms\nincrease markups for all products, but markup increases decline with\nfirm-product-specific marginal costs of production. We find robust\nevidence for our theoretical predictions using Brazilian customs data\ncontaining destination-specific and product-specific export sales and\nquantities. The sample period covers the years 1997-2006, during\nwhich Brazil experienced a series of drastic currency fluctuations.\n(JEL F14, F31, F33, O19, O24)",
