    "description": "\"Hide-and-seek\" games are zero-sum two-person games in which one player wins\nby matching the other's decision and the other wins by mismatching. Although such\ngames are often played on cultural or geographic \"landscapes\" that frame decisions\nnonneutrally, equilibrium ignores such framing. This paper reconsiders the\nresults of experiments by Rubinstein, Tversky, and others whose designs model\nnonneutral landscapes, in which subjects deviate systematically from equilibrium\nin response to them. Comparing alternative explanations theoretically and econometrically\nsuggests that the deviations are well explained by a structural nonequilibrium\nmodel of initial responses based on \"level-k\" thinking, suitably adapted to\nnonneutral landscapes.
