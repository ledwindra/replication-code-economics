    "description": "This paper estimates taxable income responses using a series of\nDanish tax reforms and population-wide administrative data since\n1980. The tax variation and data in Denmark makes it possible to\novercome the biases from nontax changes in inequality and mean\nreversion that plague the existing literature. We provide compelling\ngraphical evidence of taxable income responses, arguably representing the first nonparametrically identified evidence of taxable income elasticities using tax reforms. We also present panel regression evidence that is extremely robust to specification, unlike previous results which have been very sensitive.",
