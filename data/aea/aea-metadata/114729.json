    "description": "Participation of beneficiaries in the monitoring of public services is\nincreasingly seen as a key to improving their quality. We conducted\na randomized evaluation of three interventions to encourage beneficiaries'\nparticipation to India: providing information on existing\ninstitutions, training community members in a testing tool for children,\nand training volunteers to hold remedial reading camps. These\ninterventions had no impact on community involvement, teacher\neffort, or learning outcomes inside the school. However, in the third\nintervention, youth volunteered to teach camps, and children who\nattended substantially improved their reading skills. This suggests\nthat citizens face constraints in influencing public services. (JEL\nH52, I21, I28, O15)",
