    "description": "This paper examines behavior in a tournament in which we vary\nthe tournament prize structure and the available information about\nparticipants' skill at the task of solving mazes. The number of solved\nmazes is lowest when payments are independent of performance;\nhigher when a single, large prize is given; and highest when multiple,\ndifferentiated prizes are given. This result is strongest when\nwe inform participants about the number of mazes they and others\nsolved in a pre-tournament round. Some participants reported that\nthey solved more mazes than they actually solved, and this misreporting\nalso peaked with multiple differentiated prizes. (JEL D82)",
