    "description": "This study evaluates the short-term impacts of a livestock transfer and training program in Nepal using an RCT with three treatments to capture differential effects of program components. We also evaluate a unique \"pay it forward\" program rule where recipients are encouraged to share newly acquired knowledge and accumulated wealth to other households in need. After 1.5 years, financial inclusion increases by 0.3 standard deviations and empowerment increases by 0.2 standard deviations among direct beneficiaries. \"Pay it forward\" impacts are of approximately the same magnitude as direct beneficiaries in the treatments that include encouragement to \"pay it forward.\"",
