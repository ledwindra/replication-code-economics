    "description": "Consumers may overestimate the precision of their demand forecasts. This\noverconfidence creates an incentive for both monopolists and competitive firms\nto offer tariffs with included quantities at zero marginal cost, followed by steep\nmarginal charges. This matches observed cellular phone service pricing plans\nin the United States and elsewhere. An alternative explanation with common\npriors can be ruled out in favor of overconfidence based on observed customer\nusage patterns for a major US cellular phone service provider. The model can\nbe reinterpreted to explain the use of flat rates and late fees in rental markets,\nand teaser rates on loans. Nevertheless, firms may benefit from consumers losing\ntheir overconfidence. (JEL D12, L11, L96)",
