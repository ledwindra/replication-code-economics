    "description": "Five stationary concepts for completely mixed 2 x 2-games are experimentally\ncompared: Nash equilibrium, quantal response equilibrium, action-sampling\nequilibrium, payoff-sampling equilibrium (Martin J. Osborne and Ariel\nRubinstein 1998), and impulse balance equilibrium. Experiments on 12\ngames, 6 constant sum games, and 6 nonconstant sum games were run with 12\nindependent subject groups for each constant sum game and 6 independent\nsubject groups for each nonconstant sum game. Each independent subject\ngroup consisted of four players 1 and four players 2, interacting\nanonymously over 200 periods with random matching. The comparison of the\nfive theories shows that the order of performance from best to worst is as\nfollows: impulse balance equilibrium, payoff-sampling equilibrium,\naction-sampling equilibrium, quantal response equilibrium, Nash\nequilibrium.",
