    "description": "Causal estimates of the benefits of increased schooling using U.S.\nstate schooling laws as instruments typically rely on specifications\nwhich assume common trends across states in the factors affecting\ndifferent birth cohorts. Differential changes across states during\nthis period, such as relative school quality improvements, suggest\nthat this assumption may fail to hold. Across a number of outcomes including wages, unemployment, and divorce, we find that\nstatistically significant causal estimates become insignificant and,\nin many instances, wrong-signed when allowing year of birth effects\nto vary across regions.",
