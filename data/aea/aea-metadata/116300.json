    "description": "We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to investigate how\nhouseholds portfolio allocations change in response to wealth fluctuations.\nPersistent habits, consumption commitments, and subsistence levels can\ngenerate time-varying risk aversion with the consequence that when the\nlevel of liquid wealth changes, the proportion a household invests in\nrisky assets should also change in the same direction. In contrast, our\nanalysis shows that the share of liquid assets that households invest in\nrisky assets is not affected by wealth changes. Instead, one of the major\ndrivers of household portfolio allocation seems to be inertia: households\nrebalance only very slowly following inflows and outflows or capital gains\nand losses.",
