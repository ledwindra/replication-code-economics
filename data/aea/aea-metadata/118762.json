    "description": "We build an empirical\nmodel to attribute delays in mortgage refinancing to psychological costs\ninhibiting refinancing until incentives are sufficiently strong; and\nbehavior---potentially attributable to information-gathering costs---lowering\nthe probability of household refinancing per unit time at any incentive. We\nestimate the model on administrative panel data from Denmark, where mortgage\nrefinancing without cash-out is unconstrained.nbsp; Middle-aged and wealthy\nhouseholds act like they have high psychological refinancing costs; but older,\npoorer, and less educated households refinance with lower probability\nirrespective of incentives, thereby achieving lower savings.nbsp; We use the\nmodel to understand frictions in the mortgage channel of monetary policy\ntransmission.We build an empirical\nmodel to attribute delays in mortgage refinancing to psychological costs\ninhibiting refinancing until incentives are sufficiently strong; and\nbehavior---potentially attributable to information-gathering costs---lowering\nthe probability of household refinancing per unit time at any incentive.
