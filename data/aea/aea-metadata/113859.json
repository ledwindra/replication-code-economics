    "description": "Fuel economy standards change the composition of the vehicle fleet,\ninfluencing accident safety. The direction and size of the effect depend\non the combination of vehicles in the fleet. I provide empirical estimates\nof vehicle safety across classes, accounting for unobserved\ndriving behavior and selection. I apply the model to the present\nstructure of US fuel economy standards, accounting for shifts in the\ncomposition of vehicle ownership, and estimate an adverse safety\neffect of 33 cents per gallon of gasoline saved. I show how two alternative\nregulatory provisions fully offset this effect, producing a nearzero\nchange in accident fatalities.",
