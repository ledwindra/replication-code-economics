    "description": "We investigate the sources of the important shifts in the volatility of US\nmacroeconomic variables in the postwar period. To this end, we propose the\nestimation of DSGE models allowing for time variation in the volatility of\nthe structural innovations. We apply our estimation strategy to a\nlarge-scale model of the business cycle and find that shocks specific to\nthe equilibrium condition of investment account for most of the sharp\ndecline in volatility of the last two decades.",
