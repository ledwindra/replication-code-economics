    "description": "Labor supply theory predicts systematic heterogeneity in the impact of recent welfare\nreforms on earnings, transfers, and income. Yet most welfare reform research focuses\non mean impacts. We investigate the importance of heterogeneity using randomassignment\ndata from Connecticut\u0092s Jobs First waiver, which features key elements of\npost-1996 welfare programs. Estimated quantile treatment effects exhibit the substantial\nheterogeneity predicted by labor supply theory. Thus mean impacts miss a great deal.\nLooking separately at samples of dropouts and other women does not improve the\nperformance of mean impacts. We conclude that welfare reform\u0092s effects are likely both\nmore varied and more extensive than has been recognized. (JEL D31, I38, J31)",
