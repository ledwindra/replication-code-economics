    "description": "Arguably the most aggressive affirmative action program ever implemented in the\nUnited States was a series of court-ordered racial hiring quotas imposed on\nmunicipal police departments. My best estimate of the effect of court-ordered\naffirmative action on work-force composition is a 14-percentage-point gain in the\nfraction African American among newly hired officers. Evidence on police performance\nis mixed. Despite substantial black-white test score differences on police\ndepartment entrance examinations, city crime rates appear unaffected by litigation.\nHowever, litigation lowers slightly both arrests per crime and the fraction black\namong serious arrestees.
