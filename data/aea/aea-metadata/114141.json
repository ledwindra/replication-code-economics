    "description": "A substantial fraction of workers are underemployed, i.e., employed in jobs for which they are overqualified, and that fraction\u2014the underemployment rate\u2014is higher in \nrecessions. To explain these facts, we build a search model with an endogenous \"ranking\" mechanism, in which high-skill applicants are systematically hired over less-skilled \ncompeting applicants. Some high-skill workers become underemployed in order to escape the competition for high-skill jobs and find a job more rapidly at the expense of \nless-skilled workers. Quantitatively, the model can capture the key characteristics of underemployment, notably the fact that both the underemployment rate and the wage \nloss associated with becoming underemployed increase in recessions.",
