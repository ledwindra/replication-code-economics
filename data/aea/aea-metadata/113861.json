    "description": "We conduct a randomized evaluation of the effect of village-based\nschools on children's academic performance using a sample of 31\nvillages and 1,490 children in rural northwestern Afghanistan. The\nprogram significantly increases enrollment and test scores among\nall children, but particularly for girls. Girls' enrollment increases by\n52 percentage points and their average test scores increase by 0.65\nstandard deviations. The effect is large enough that it eliminates\nthe gender gap in enrollment and dramatically reduces differences\nin test scores. Boys' enrollment increases by 35 percentage points,\nand average test scores increase by 0.40 standard deviations.",
