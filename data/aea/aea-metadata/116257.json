    "description": "A new 45-industry, 23-year, dataset for Japan is used to investigate the duration of\nindustry leadership. A new scaling relationship linking a firm's current market\nshare with the standard deviation of market share changes is reported. This\nrelationship discriminates in a powerful way between rival candidate theoretical\nmodels of market share dynamics. It also makes possible a useful simplification in\ntesting a benchmark model of a Markovian kind. Relative to that model, it is found\nthat at least some industries display a \"Chandlerian\" bias toward longer durations\nof leadership than would be present in the benchmark model. (JEL D43, L13)",
