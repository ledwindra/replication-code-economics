    "description": "We study cascades of failures in a network of interdependent financial\norganizations: how discontinuous changes in asset values\n(e.g., defaults and shutdowns) trigger further failures, and how this\ndepends on network structure. Integration (greater dependence on\ncounterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting\ncascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are\nbetter insured against one another's failures. Integration also faces\ntrade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less\nsensitivity to own investments. Finally, we illustrate the model with\ndata on European debt cross-holdings.",
