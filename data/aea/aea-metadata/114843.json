    "description": "Researchers often estimate average treatment effects of programs\nwithout investigating heterogeneity across units. Yet, individuals,\nfirms, regions, or countries vary in their ability to utilize transfers.\nWe analyze Objective 1 transfers of the EU to regions below a\ncertain income level by way of a regression discontinuity design with\nsystematically varying heterogeneous treatment effects. Only about\n30 percent and 21 percent of the regions\u2014those with sufficient human\ncapital and good-enough institutions\u2014are able to turn transfers\ninto faster per capita income growth and per capita investment,\nrespectively. In general, the variance of the treatment effect is much\nbigger than its mean.",
