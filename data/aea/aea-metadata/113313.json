    "description": "We experimentally study decentralized organizational learning. Our objective\nis to understand how learning members of an organization cope with the confounding\neffects of the simultaneous learning of others. We test the predictions of\na stylized, rational agent model of organizational learning that provides sharp\npredictions as to how learning members of an organization might cope with the\nsimultaneous learning of others as a function of fundamental variables, e.g.,\nfirm size and the discount factor. While the problem of learning while others are\nlearning is quite difficult, we find support for the comparative static predictions\nof the model's unique symmetric equilibrium. (JEL C72, D23, D83)",
