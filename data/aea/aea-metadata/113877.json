    "description": "We set up a dynamic discrete choice model with subjective\nexpectations data to explain adult smokers'\nfind important differences between subjective survival probabilities\nand those estimated using observed mortality data. Subjectively,\nindividuals attach less weight to their health conditions and smoking\nchoices and more weight to such factors as age, race, and parents'\nlongevity. Moreover, adult smokers are found to care more about\ntheir health and to be more forward-looking than predicted by a\nrational expectations framework. We further show the importance of\nunobserved heterogeneity in agents' subjective survival probabilities,\nand discuss policy implications of subjective expectations.",
