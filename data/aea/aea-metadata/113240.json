    "description": "Policymakers often prescribe that microfinance institutions increase\ninterest rates to eliminate their reliance on subsidies. This strategy\nmakes sense if the poor are rate insensitive: then microlenders increase\nprofitability (or achieve sustainability) without reducing the poor's\naccess to credit. We test the assumption of price inelastic demand using\nrandomized trials conducted by a consumer lender in South Africa. The\ndemand curves are downward sloping, and steeper for price increases\nrelative to the lender's standard rates. We also find that loan size is\nfar more responsive to changes in loan maturity than to changes in\ninterest rates, which is consistent with binding liquidity constraints.",
