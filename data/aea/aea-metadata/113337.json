    "description": "We compare house sales on a For-Sale-By-Owner (FSBO) platform to Multiple\nListing Service (MLS) sales and find that FSBO precommission prices are no\nlower, but that FSBO is less effective in terms of time to sell and probability of\na sale. We do not find direct evidence of the importance of network size as a\nreason for the lower effectiveness of FSBO. We do find evidence of endogenous\nplatform differentiation: patient sellers use FSBO while patient buyers transact\nmore often on the MLS (where they avoid patient sellers). We discuss the\nimplications for platform competition, two-sided markets, and welfare. (JEL\nL85, M31, R31)",
