    "description": "We build a life-cycle model with earnings risk, liquidity constraints, and\nportfolio choice over tax-deferred and taxable assets to evaluate how\nhousehold consumption changes in response to shocks to transitory\nanticipated income, such as the 2001 income tax rebate. Households\noptimally invest in tax-deferred assets, which are encumbered by\nwithdrawal penalties, and exchange taxable precautionary savings\nfor higher after-tax returns. The model predicts a higher marginal\npropensity to consume out of a rebate than is predicted by a standard\nfrictionless life-cycle model. Liquidity-constrained households\u2014with\nfew financial assets or portfolios expensive to reallocate\u2014consume a\nhigher fraction of the rebates.",
