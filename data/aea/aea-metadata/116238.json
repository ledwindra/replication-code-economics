    "description": "Exploiting differences across U.S. states, this paper demonstrates that there is a\ntight link between higher education policies, past enrollment rates, and recent\nchanges in the college wage premium among labor market entrants. The analysis\nreveals, however, that this relationship is much weaker in states with high private\nenrollment rates, high levels of interstate mobility, or interstate trade. The withinstate\nestimates of the own-cohort relative supply effect shed some light on the extent\nto which the U.S. labor market can be characterized as a single national market or\na collection of state-specific labor markets.
