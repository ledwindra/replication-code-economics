    "description": "This paper examines the implicit health insurance that households\nreceive from the ability to declare bankruptcy. Exploiting multiple\nsources of variation in asset exemption law, I show that uninsured\nhouseholds with a greater financial cost of bankruptcy make higher\nout-of-pocket medical payments, conditional on the amount of\ncare received. In turn, I find that households with greater wealth at\nrisk are more likely to hold health insurance. The implicit insurance\nfrom bankruptcy distorts the insurance coverage decision. Using a\nmicrosimulation model, I calculate that the optimal Pigovian penalties\nare three-quarters as large as the average penalties under the Affordable Care Act. (JEL D14, H51, I13, K35)",
