    "description": "We use the introduction of a means-tested voucher program in Florida\nto examine whether increased competitive pressure on public schools\naffects students' test scores. We find greater score improvements in\nthe wake of the program introduction for students attending schools\nthat faced more competitive private school markets prior to the policy\nannouncement, especially those that faced the greatest financial\nincentives to retain students. These effects suggest modest benefits\nfor public school students from increased competition. The effects\nare consistent across several geocoded measures of competition and\nisolate competitive effects from changes in student composition or\nresource levels in public schools.",
