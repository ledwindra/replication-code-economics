    "description": "Empirical studies of the relationship between school inputs and test\nscores typically do not account for household responses to changes\nin school inputs. Evidence from India and Zambia shows that student\ntest scores are higher when schools receive unanticipated grants, but\nthere is no impact of grants that are anticipated. We show that the\nmost likely mechanism for this result is that households offset their\nown spending in response to anticipated grants. Our results confirm\nthe importance of optimal household responses and suggest caution\nwhen interpreting estimates of school inputs on learning outcomes\nas parameters of an education production function.
