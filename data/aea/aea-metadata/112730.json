    "description": "Bauer, Rudebusch, and Wu (2014) advocate the use of bias-corrected\nestimates in their comment on Wright (2011). Econometric estimation\nof a macro-finance VAR provides quite imprecise estimates of future\nshort-term interest rates. Nonetheless, comparison with survey\nresponses indicates that the proposed bias-corrected point estimates\nare less plausible than their maximum-likelihood counterparts.",
