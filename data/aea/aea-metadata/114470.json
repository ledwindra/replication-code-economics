    "description": "This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth, and fiscal data (including recently released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in China and Russia over the 1978\u20132015 period. We contrast the different privatization strategies implemented in the two countries and observe their impacts on the evolution of inequality.",
