    "description": "We study interdependencies in spousal labor supply by exploiting the\ndesign of the French workweek reduction, which introduced exogenous\nvariation in one's spouse's labor supply, at constant earnings.\nTreated employees work on average two hours less per week.\nHusbands of treated women respond by reducing their labor supply\nby about half an hour, consistent with substantial leisure complementarity,\nand specifically cut the nonusual component of their\nworkweek, leaving usual hours unchanged. Women's response to\ntheir husband's treatment is instead weak and rarely statistically\nsignificant, possibly due to heavier constraints in the organization of\ntheir workweek.",
