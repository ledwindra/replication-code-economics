    "description": "What explains substantial variation across countries in household stock market participation? Building on Ke (2018), I hypothesize that the prevailing gender norm in a country is an important cultural factor. In a cross-country analysis, I find that households in countries with strong gender norms are less likely to participate in the stock market. In addition, I present suggestive evidence that gender role attitudes help explain cross-country differences in participation among the wealthy. My findings underscore the role of social norms in shaping household balance sheets across countries.",
