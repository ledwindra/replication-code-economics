    "description": "We examine the link between the political\nparticipation of the young and fiscal policies in the U.S. We generate\nexogenous variation in participation using the passage of preregistration laws,\nwhich allow the young to register before being eligible to vote. After\ndocumenting that preregistration promotes youth enfranchisement, we show that\npreregistration shifts state government spending toward higher education, the\ntype of spending for which the young have the strongest preference. A 1%\nincrease in youth voter turnout generates a 0.77% increase in higher education\nspending. The results collectively suggest political responsiveness to the\nneeds of the newly enfranchised constituency.",
