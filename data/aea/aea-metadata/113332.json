    "description": "We estimate a principal-agent model of moral hazard with longitudinal data\non firms and managerial compensation over two disjoint periods spanning 60\nyears to investigate increased value and variability in managerial compensation.\nWe find exogenous growth in firm size largely explains these secular\ntrends in compensation. In our framework, exogenous firm size works through\ntwo channels. First, conflicts of interest between shareholders and managers\nare magnified in large firms, so optimal compensation plans are now more\nclosely linked to insider wealth. Second, the market for managers has become\nmore differentiated, increasing the premium paid to managers of large versus\nsmall firms. (JEL D82, L25, M12, M52)",
