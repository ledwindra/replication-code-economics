    "description": "We propose a distinction between active and passive waste as determinants of\nthe cost of public services. Active waste entails utility for the public decision\nmaker, whereas passive waste does not. We analyze purchases of standardized\ngoods by Italian public bodies and exploit a policy experiment associated\nwith a national procurement agency. We find that: (i) some public bodies pay\nsystematically more than others for equivalent goods; (ii) differences are correlated\nwith governance structure; (iii) the variation in prices is principally due\nto variation in passive rather than active waste; and (iv) passive waste accounts\nfor 83 percent of total estimated waste.
