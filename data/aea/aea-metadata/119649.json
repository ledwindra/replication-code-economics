    "description": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRural economies in many developing countries are characterized by a lean season in the\nmonths preceding harvest, when farmers have depleted their cash and grain savings from the\nprevious year. To identify the impacts of liquidity during the lean season, we offered subsidized\nloans in randomly selected villages in rural Zambia. 98 percent of households took up the loan.\nLoan eligibility led to increases in on-farm labor and agricultural output, driving up wages\nin local labor markets. Larger effects for poorer households suggest that liquidity constraints\ncontribute to inequality in rural economies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
