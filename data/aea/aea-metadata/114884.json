    "description": "We exploit a cohort discontinuity in the stringency of Dutch disability\nreforms to estimate the effects of decreased DI (disability insurance)\ngenerosity on behavior of existing recipients. We find evidence of\nsocial support substitution: individuals on average offset \u20ac1.00 of\nlost DI benefits by collecting \u20ac0.30 more from other social assistance\nprograms, but this benefit-substitution effect declines over time.\nIndividuals also exhibit a rebound in earnings: earnings increase by\n\u20ac0.62 on average per euro of lost DI benefits and this effect remains\nroughly constant over time. This is strong evidence of substantial\nremaining earnings capacity among long-term claimants of DI.",
