    "description": "The tax burden on equity securities has varied substantially over time and\nremains a source of continuing policy debate. This paper investigates whether\ninvestors were compensated for the tax burden of equity securities over the\nperiod between 1913 and 2006. Taxes on equity securities vary over time due to\nchanges in dividend and capital gains tax rates and due to changes in corporate\npayout policies. Equity taxes also vary across firms due to persistent differences\nin propensities to pay dividends. The results indicate an economically plausible\nand statistically significant tax capitalization over time and cross-sectionally.\n(JEL G10, G12, H22, H24, N21, N22)",
