    "description": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe assess whether financing can help private schools, which now account for one-\nthird of primary school enrollment in low- and middle-income countries. Our ex-\nperiment allocated unconditional cash grants to either one (L) or all (H) private\nschools in a village. In both arms, enrollment and revenues increased, leading\nto above market returns. However, test scores increased only in H schools, accompanied by higher fees, and a greater focus on teachers. We provide a model\ndemonstrating that market forces can provide endogenous incentives to increase\nquality and increased financial saturation can be used to leverage competition,\ngenerating socially desirable outcomes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
