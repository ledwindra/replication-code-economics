    "description": "Economists generally assume that the state has sufficient institutional capacity\nto support markets and levy taxes. This paper develops a framework where\n\"policy choices\" in market regulation and taxation are constrained by past\ninvestments in legal and fiscal capacity. It studies the economic and political\ndeterminants of such investments, demonstrating that legal and fiscal capacity\nare typically complements. The results show that, among other things, common\ninterest public goods, such as fighting external wars, as well as political stability\nand inclusive political institutions, are conducive to building state capacity.\nSome correlations in cross-country data are consistent with the theory.
