    "description": "Aggregate and sectoral comovement are central features of business cycles, so\nthe ability to generate comovement is a natural litmus test for macroeconomic\nmodels. But it is a test that most models fail. We propose a unified model that\ngenerates aggregate and sectoral comovement in response to contemporaneous\nand news shocks about fundamentals. The fundamentals that we consider are\naggregate and sectoral total factor productivity shocks as well as investment-specific\ntechnical change. The model has three key elements: variable capital\nutilization, adjustment costs to investment, and preferences that allow us to\nparameterize the strength of short-run wealth effects on the labor supply.
