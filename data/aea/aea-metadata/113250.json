    "description": "This paper analyzes how US presidential candidates should allocate resources\nacross states to maximize the probability of winning the election, by\ndeveloping and estimating a probabilistic-voting model of political\ncompetition under the Electoral College system. Actual campaigns act in\nclose agreement with the model. There is a 0.9 correlation between\nequilibrium and actual presidential campaign visits across states, both in\n2000 and 2004. The paper shows how presidential candidate attention is\naffected by the states' number of electoral votes, forecasted\nstate-election outcomes, and forecast uncertainty. It also analyzes the\neffects of a direct national popular vote for president.",
