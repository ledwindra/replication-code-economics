    "description": "The effect of competition on the quality of health care remains\na contested issue. Most empirical estimates rely on inference\nfrom nonexperimental data. In contrast, this paper exploits a procompetitive\npolicy reform to provide estimates of the impact of\ncompetition on hospital outcomes. The English government introduced\na policy in 2006 to promote competition between hospitals. Using\nthis policy to implement a difference-in-differences research design,\nwe estimate the impact of the introduction of competition on not only\nclinical outcomes but also productivity and expenditure. We find\nthat the effect of competition is to save lives without raising costs.",
