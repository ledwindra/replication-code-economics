    "description": "Sanctioning institutions are of utmost importance for overcoming free-riding\ntendencies and enforcing outcomes that maximize group welfare in social\ndilemma situations. We investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the\nendogenous formation of institutions in public goods provision. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows that players may form sanctioning institutions in equilibrium,\nincluding those governing only a subset of players. The experiment confirms\nthat institutions are formed and that it positively affects cooperation and group\nwelfare. However, the data also shows that success is not guaranteed. Players\nare unwilling to implement equilibrium institutions in which some players have\nthe opportunity to free ride. Our results emphasize the role of fairness in the\ninstitution formation process. (JEL C72, D02, H41)",
