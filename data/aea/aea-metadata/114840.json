    "description": "Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation\n(SIPP), we study the health insurance and labor market implications\nof the recent Affordable Care Act (ACA) provision that allows\ndependents to remain on parental policies until age 26. Our comparison\nof outcomes for young adults aged 19-25 with those who are\nolder and younger, before and after the law, shows a high take-up of\nparental coverage, resulting in substantial reductions in uninsurance\nand other forms of coverage. We also find preliminary evidence of\nincreased labor market flexibility in the form of reduced work hours.",
