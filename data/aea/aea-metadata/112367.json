    "description": "We investigate political determinants of land reform implementation in the\nIndian state of West Bengal. Using a village panel spanning 1974-1998, we do\nnot find evidence supporting the hypothesis that land reforms were positively and monotonically related to control of local governments by a Left Front coalition vis-\u00e0-vis the right-centrist Congress party, combined with lack of commitment to policy platforms. Instead, the evidence is consistent with a quasi-Downsian theory stressing the role of opportunism (reelection concerns) and electoral competition. (JEL D72, O13, O17, Q15)",
