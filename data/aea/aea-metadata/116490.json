    "description": "Female genital cutting (FGC) affects more than 200 million women globally. Education is often depicted as an effective instrument for abandoning the practice, but causal evidence is scant. This paper uses the introduction of the Universal Primary Education program in Nigeria as a natural experiment to identify the causal effect of mothers\u2019 education on the probability that their daughters are cut. Household survey data indicate no statistically significant impact of the reform on the probability that daughters undergo FGC, which may be explained by an insignificant effect of the reform on maternal support for the practice.",
