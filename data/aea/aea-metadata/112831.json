    "description": "We estimate the causal effect of a large development program on conflict in the\nPhilippines through a regression discontinuity design that exploits an arbitrary poverty\nthreshold used to assign eligibility for the program. We find that barely eligible municipalities experienced a large increase in conflict casualties compared to barely ineligible\nones. This increase is mostly due to insurgent-initiated incidents in the early stages of\nprogram preparation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that insurgents\ntry to sabotage the program because its success would weaken their support in the\npopulation.",
