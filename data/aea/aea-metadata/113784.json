    "description": "In 2004, the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez regime in Venezuela distributed the list of\nseveral million voters who had attempted to remove him from office\nthroughout the government bureaucracy, allegedly to identify and punish these voters. We match the list of petition signers distributed by the government to household survey respondents to measure the economic effects of being identified as a Ch\u00e1vez political opponent. We find that voters who were identified as Ch\u00e1vez opponents experienced a 5 percent drop in earnings and a 1.3 percentage point drop in employment rates after the voter list was released.
