    "description": "The existing literature typically does not differentiate between security returns\nand the returns of investors in these securities. This study clarifies that investor\nand security returns differ because of the timing and magnitude of investor\ncapital flows into and out of these securities. The empirical results indicate that\nactual investor returns are systematically lower than buy-and-hold returns for\nnearly all major international stock markets. These results imply that the\nhistorical equity premium and the cost of equity capital are likely lower than\npreviously thought. (JEL G11, G12, G15)",
