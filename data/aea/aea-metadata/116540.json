    "description": "We examine the long-term effects of a 1998-2003 randomized experiment in Tulsa, Oklahoma with Individual Development Accounts\nthat offered low-income households 2:1 matching funds for housing\ndown payments. Prior work shows that, among households who\nrented in 1998, homeownership rates increased more through 2003\nin the treatment group than for controls. We show that control group\nrenters caught up rapidly with the treatment group after the experiment ended. As of 2009, the program had an economically small and statistically insignificant effect on homeownership rates, the number of years respondents owned homes, home equity, and foreclosure activity among baseline renters.
