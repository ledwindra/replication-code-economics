    "description": "In 2002, the Mexican government began an effort to improve health\naccess to the 50 million uninsured in Mexico, a program known as\nSeguro Popular (SP). The SP offered virtually free health insurance\nto informal workers, altering the incentives to operate in the formal\neconomy. We find that the SP program had a negative effect on the\nnumber of employers and employees formally registered in small and\nmedium firms (up to 50 employees). Our results suggest that the positive gains of expanding health coverage should be weighed against the implications of the reallocation of labor away from the formal sector.",
