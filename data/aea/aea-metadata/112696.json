    "description": "I develop a highly tractable general equilibrium model in which\nheterogeneous producers face collateral constraints, and study the\neffect of financial frictions on capital misallocation and aggregate\nproductivity. My economy is isomorphic to a Solow model but with\ntime-varying TFP. I argue that the persistence of idiosyncratic productivity shocks determines both the size of steady-state productivity losses and the speed of transitions: if shocks are persistent, steady-state losses are small but transitions are slow. Even if financial frictions are unimportant in the long run, they tend to matter in the short run and analyzing steady states only can be misleading.",
