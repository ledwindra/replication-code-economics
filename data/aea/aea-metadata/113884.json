    "description": "One of the most consistent findings in the literature on teacher\nquality is that teachers improve with experience, especially in the\nfirst several years. This study extends this research by separately\nidentifying the benefits of general teaching experience and specific\ncurriculum familiarity. I find that both specific and general human\ncapital contribute to teacher improvement and that recent specific\nexperience is more valuable than distant specific experience. This\npaper also contributes to a broader literature on human capital\nacquisition, as it is among the first to examine human capital\nspecificity using a direct measure of productivity.",
