    "description": "How do changes in labor market institutions, like more generous\nunemployment benefits in one country, affect labor market outcomes\nin other countries? We set up a two-country Armingtonian trade\nmodel with frictions on the goods and labor markets. Contrary to the\nliterature, higher labor market frictions increase unemployment at\nhome and abroad. The strength of the spillover depends on the relative size of countries and on trade costs. It is exacerbated when real wages are rigid. Using panel data for 20 rich OECD countries, and\ncontrolling for institutions as well as for business cycle comovement,\nwe confirm our theoretical predictions. (JEL E24, F16, J64, J65)",
