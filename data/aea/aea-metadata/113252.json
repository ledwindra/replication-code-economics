    "description": "Charles Tiebout's suggestion that people \"vote with their feet\" for\ncommunities with optimal bundles of taxes and public goods has played a\ncentral role in local public finance for over 50 years. Using a locational\nequilibrium model, we derive formal tests of his premise. The model\npredicts increased population density in neighborhoods experiencing\nexogenous improvements in public goods and, for large improvements,\nincreased relative mean incomes. We test these hypotheses in the context\nof changing air quality. Our results provide strong empirical support for\nthe notion that households \"vote with their feet\" for environmental\nquality.",
