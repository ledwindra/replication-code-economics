    "description": "This paper derives empirically tractable formulas for the welfare effects of\nfare adjustments in passenger peak and off-peak rail and bus transit, and for\noptimal pricing of those services. The formulas account for congestion, pollution,\naccident externalities, scale economies, and agency adjustment of transit\nservice offerings. We apply them using parameter values for Washington (DC),\nLos Angeles, and London. The results support the efficiency of the large current\nfare subsidies; even starting with fares at 50 percent of operating costs,\nincremental fare reductions are welfare improving in almost all cases. These\nfindings are robust to alternative assumptions and parameters. (JEL L92, R41,\nR42, R48)",
