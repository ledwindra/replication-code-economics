    "description": "We show that the risk-shock business cycle model of\nFern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde et al. (2011) must be recalibrated because\nit underpredicts the targeted business cycle moments by a factor\nof three once a time aggregation error is corrected. Recalibrating\nthe corrected model for the benchmark case of Argentina, the peak\nresponse and the contribution of interest rate risk shocks to business\ncycle volatility increase. However, the recalibrated model does\nworse in capturing the business cycle properties of net exports once\nan additional error in the computation of net exports is corrected.",
