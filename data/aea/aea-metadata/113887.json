    "description": "Welfare programs are often implemented in-kind to promote outcomes\nthat might not be realized under cash transfers. This paper\ntests whether such paternalistically motivated transfers are justified\ncompared to cash, using a randomized controlled trial of Mexico's\nfood assistance program. In relation to total food consumption, the\nin-kind transfer was infra-marginal and nondistorting. However, the\ntransfer contained ten food items, and there was large variation in\nthe extent to which individual foods were extra-marginal and distorting.\nSmall differences in the nutritional intake of women and children\nunder in-kind transfers did not lead to meaningful differential\nimprovements in health outcomes compared to cash.",
