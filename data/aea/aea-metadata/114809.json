    "description": "Targeting assistance to the poor is a central problem in development.\nWe study the problem of designing a proxy means test when\nthe implementing agent is corruptible. Conditioning on more poverty\nindicators may worsen targeting in this environment because of\na novel tradeoff between statistical accuracy and enforceability. We\nthen test necessary conditions for this tradeoff using data on Below\nPoverty Line card allocation in India. Less eligible households pay\nlarger bribes and are less likely to obtain cards, but widespread rule\nviolations yield a de facto allocation much less progressive than the\nde jure one. Enforceability appears to matter. (JEL D12, I32, I38,\nO12, O15)",
