    "description": "We re-examine the Lake Wobegon effect for reported GPA using data from students enrolled in principles of economics courses. Students are well known to over-report their GPA on surveys. In addition to standard measures of the mean difference, we extend the analysis to understand the distribution of response error using quantile regression analysis. We also examine how survey conditions impact response error. Our findings suggest that response error is more complicated than simple over-confidence. Students respond differently throughout the distribution of GPA and respond differently when seated near friends. Modeling response error should take these findings into account.",
