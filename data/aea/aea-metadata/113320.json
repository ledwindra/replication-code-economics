    "description": "Policy analysis with potentially misspecified dynamic stochastic general equilibrium\n(DSGE) models faces two challenges: estimation of parameters that\nare relevant for policy trade-offs, and treatment of the deviations from the\ncross-equation restrictions. Using post-1982 US data, we study the robustness\nof the policy prescriptions from a state-of-the-art DSGE model with respect to\ntwo approaches to model misspecification pursued in the recent literature: (i)\nadding shocks to the DSGE model and/or generalizing the processes followed\nby these shocks; and (ii) explicit modeling of deviations from cross-equation\nrestrictions (DSGE-VAR).
