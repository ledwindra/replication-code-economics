    "description": "While numerous studies have found that school accountability\nboosts test scores, it is uncertain whether estimated test score gains\nreflect genuine improvements or merely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gaming\u00e2\u20ac\u009d behaviors. This\npaper brings to bear new evidence from a unique five-year, three-round survey conducted of a census of public elementary schools in Florida that is linked with detailed administrative data on student performance. We show that schools facing accountability pressure changed their instructional practices in meaningful ways, and\nthat these responses can explain a portion of the test score gains\nassociated with the Florida school accountability system.
