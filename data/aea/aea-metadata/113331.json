    "description": "This paper argues for efficient environmental regulations that equate the marginal\ndamage of pollution to marginal abatement costs across space. The paper\nestimates the source-specific marginal damages of air pollution and calculates\nthe welfare gain from making the current sulfur dioxide allowance trading program\nfor power plants more efficient. The savings from using trading ratios\nbased on marginal damages are between $310 and $940 million per year. The\npotential savings from setting aggregate emissions efficiently and from including\nmore sources of air pollution are many times higher. (JEL H23, Q53, Q58)",
