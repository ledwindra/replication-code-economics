    "description": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe dissect the impact of a large and sudden exchange rate appreciation on Swiss\nborder import prices, retail prices, and consumer expenditures on domestic and imported\nnon-durable goods, following the removal of the EUR/CHF floor in January 2015.\nCross-sectional variation in border price changes by currency of invoicing carries over\nto consumer prices and allocations, impacting retail prices of imports and competing\ndomestic goods, as well as import expenditures. We provide measures of the sensitivity of\nretail import prices to border prices and the sensitivity of import shares to relative prices,\nwhich is higher when using retail prices than border prices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
