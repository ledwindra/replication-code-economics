    "description": "We use oil price fluctuations to test the impact of transfers from\nwealthy OPEC nations to their poorer Muslim allies. The instrument\nidentifies plausibly exogenous variation in foreign aid. We investigate\nhow aid is spent by tracking its short-run effect on aggregate\ndemand, national accounts, and balance of payments. Aid affects\nmost components of GDP though it has no statistically identifiable\nimpact on prices or economic growth. Much aid is consumed, primarily\nin the form of imported noncapital goods. Aid substitutes for\ndomestic savings, has no effect on the financial account, and leads\nto unaccounted capital flight. (JEL F35, O19)",
