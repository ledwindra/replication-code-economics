    "description": "This paper reports laboratory experiments that evaluate the performance\nof a flexible package bidding format developed by the FCC,\nin comparison with other combinatorial formats. In general, the\ninterest of policy makers in combinatorial auctions is justified by the\nlaboratory data. When value complementarities are present, package\nbidding yields improved performance. We find clear differences\namong the combinatorial auction formats both in terms of efficiency\nand seller revenue, however. Notably, the combinatorial clock provides\nthe highest revenue. The FCC's flexible package bidding format\nperformed worse than the alternatives, which is one of the main\nreasons why it was not implemented. (JEL D44, H82)",
