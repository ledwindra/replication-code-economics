    "description": "Separate identification of the price and quantity of human capital\nhas important implications for understanding key issues in economics.\nPrice and quantity series are derived for four education levels.\nThe price series are highly correlated and they exhibit a strong secular\ntrend. Three resulting implications are explored: the rising college\npremium is found to be driven more by relative quantity than\nrelative price changes, life-cycle wage profiles are readily interpretable\nas reflecting optimal human capital investment paths using\nthe estimated price series, and adjusting the labor input for quality\nincreases dramatically reduces the contribution of MFP to growth.\n(JEL D91, I20, J24, J31, O47)",
