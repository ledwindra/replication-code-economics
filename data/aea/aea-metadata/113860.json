    "description": "Computers are an important part of modern education, yet many\nschoolchildren lack access to a computer at home. We test whether this\nimpedes educational achievement by conducting the largest-ever field\nexperiment that randomly provides free home computers to students.\nAlthough computer ownership and use increased substantially,\nwe find no effects on any educational outcomes, including grades,\ntest scores, credits earned, attendance, and disciplinary actions.\nOur estimates are precise enough to rule out even modestly-sized\npositive or negative impacts. The estimated null effect is consistent\nwith survey evidence showing no change in homework time or other\n\"intermediate\" inputs in education.",
