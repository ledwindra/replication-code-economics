    "description": "We study the dynamics of economic and political change, theoretically\nand empirically. Democratic capital measured by a nation's\nhistorical experience with democracy, and the incidence of democracy\nin its neighborhood, appears to reduce exit rates from democracy\nand raise exit rates from autocracy. Higher democratic\ncapital stimulates growth by increasing the stability of democracies.\nHeterogeneous effects of democracy induce sorting of countries into\npolitical regimes, which helps explain systematic differences between\ndemocracies and autocracies. Our results suggest the possibility of\na virtuous circle, where accumulation of physical and democratic\ncapital reinforce each other, promoting economic development and\nconsolidation of democracy.
