    "description": "This study develops a theoretical model of a multinational firm\nwith an internal capital market. Hypotheses regarding the role of\nlocal versus foreign characteristics such as profit tax rates, lack of\ninstitutional quality, financial underdevelopment, and productivity\nfor internal debt financing at the level of foreign affiliates are derived\nand assessed empirically in a panel dataset covering the universe\nof German multinationals. We show that differences in nontax\nincentives given by fundamentals in local and foreign markets can\noffset or reinforce tax incentives. The results point at a many times\nhigher tax-sensitivity of internal debt financing compared to previous\nresearch.",
