    "description": "Although technology-driven economic growth generates gains in consumption and employment opportunities, it may also negatively impact other dimensions of well-being, such as emotional well-being or sense of stability. We study 204 aspects of self-reported well-being among 1,576 US MTurk survey respondents, aggregated into seven themes: evaluative well-being, emotional well-being, positive perceptions of technology or economic growth, autonomy and flexibility, work environment, feelings of calmness and stability, and feelings of belonging and connection. Demographic associations with aspects of well-being vary somewhat across the themes. We highlight the value of a multidimensional approach when comparing well-being across different groups in the United States.",
