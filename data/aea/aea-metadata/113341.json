    "description": "Contrary to what is usually assumed, the expected revenue for lenders as a\nfunction of the loan rate cannot be globally hump-shaped in the Stiglitz-Weiss\n(1981) adverse selection model with a continuum of types. This has important\nimplications. First, if there is credit rationing, there must be at least two equilibrium\nloan rates. Second, while at the low rate loans are rationed, all those\napplicants willing to pay the high rate are then served. Numerical analysis\nshows that unless the joint distribution of risk class and output is rather special,\nthe two loan rate outcome with rationing is unlikely. (JEL D82, G21)",
