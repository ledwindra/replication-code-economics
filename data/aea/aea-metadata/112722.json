    "description": "We develop a model in which connections between individuals serve\nas social collateral to enforce informal insurance payments. We show\nthat: (i) The degree of insurance is governed by the expansiveness of\nthe network, measured with the per capita number of connections\nthat groups have with the rest of the community. \"Two-dimensional\"\nnetworks\u2014like real-world networks in Peruvian villages\u2014are sufficiently\nexpansive to allow very good risk-sharing. (ii) In second-\nbest\narrangements, insurance is local: agents fully share shocks within,\nbut imperfectly between endogenously emerging risk-sharing groups.\nWe also discuss how endogenous social collateral affects our results.",
