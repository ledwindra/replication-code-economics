    "description": "Most previous studies on intertemporal labor supply found very small or insignificant\nsubstitution effects. It is possible that these results are due to constraints on\nworkers' labor supply choices. We conducted a field experiment in a setting in which\nworkers were free to choose hours worked and effort per hour. We document a large\npositive elasticity of overall labor supply and an even larger elasticity of hours,\nwhich implies that the elasticity of effort per hour is negative. We examine two\ncandidate models to explain these findings: a modified neoclassical model with\npreference spillovers across periods, and a model with reference dependent, lossaverse\npreferences. With the help of a further experiment, we can show that only\nloss-averse individuals exhibit a negative effort response to the wage increase. (JEL\nJ22, J31)",
