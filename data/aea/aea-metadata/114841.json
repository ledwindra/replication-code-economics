    "description": "This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of crossstate\nexternalities associated with gun regulations that impact gun\ntrafficking. Using tracing data, which identify the source state for\ncrime guns recovered in destination states, we find that firearms tend\nto flow from states with weak laws to states with strict laws, satisfying\na key theoretical condition for the existence of externalities. We\nalso find that gun flows are more significant between nearby states,\nsuggesting that externalities are spatial in nature. Finally, we present\nevidence that criminal possession of guns is higher in states exposed\nto weak laws in nearby states.",
