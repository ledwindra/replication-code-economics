    "description": "German separation in 1949 into a communist East and a\ncapitalist West and their reunification in 1990 are commonly described as a\nnatural experiment to study the enduring effects of communism. We show in three\nsteps that the populations in East and West Germany were far from being\nrandomly selected treatment and control groups. First, using pre-World War II data,\nthe later border is already visible in many socio-economic characteristics.\nSecond, World War II and the subsequent occupying forces affected East and West\ndifferently. Third, a selective fifth of the population fled from East to West\nGermany before the building of the Wall in 1961. In light of our findings, we\npropose a more cautious interpretation of the extensive literature on the enduring\neffects of communist systems on economic outcomes, political preferences,\ncultural traits, and gender roles. \n\n",
