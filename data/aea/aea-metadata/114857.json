    "description": "We estimate the elasticity of corporate taxable income with respect to\nthe statutory corporation tax rate using the population of UK corporation\ntax returns. We analyze bunching in the distribution of taxable\nincome at kinks in the marginal rate schedule. We decompose this\nelasticity into an elasticity of total income with respect to the corporation\ntax rate, and an elasticity of the share of income taken as profit\nwith respect to the difference between the personal and corporate tax\nrates. This implies a marginal deadweight cost at the \u00a310,000 kink of\naround 29 percent of tax revenue.",
