    "description": "In most health insurance markets in the United States, consumers have substantial choice about their health insurance plan. However additional choice is not an unmixed blessing as it \ncreates challenges related to both consumer confusion and adverse selection. There is mounting evidence that many people have difficulty understanding the value of insurance coverage, \nlike evaluating the relative benefits of lower premiums versus lower deductibles. Also, in most US health insurance markets, people cannot be charged different prices for insurance based on \ntheir individual level of health risk. This creates the potential for well-known problems of adverse selection because people will often base the level of health insurance coverage they choose \npartly on their health status. In this essay, we examine how the forces of consumer confusion and adverse selection interact with each other and with market institutions to affect how \nvaluable it is to have multiple levels of health insurance coverage available in the market.",
