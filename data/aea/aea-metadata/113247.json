    "description": "In several school choice districts in the United States, the student\nproposing deferred acceptance algorithm is applied after indifferences in\npriority orders are broken in some exogenous way. Although such a\ntie-breaking procedure preserves stability, it adversely affects the\nwelfare of the students since it introduces artificial stability\nconstraints. Our main finding is a polynomial-time algorithm for the\ncomputation of a student-optimal stable matching when priorities are weak.\nThe idea behind our construction relies on a new notion which we call a\nstable improvement cycle. We also investigate the strategic properties of\nthe student-optimal stable mechanism.",
