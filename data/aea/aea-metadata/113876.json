    "description": "Agriculture on the American Plains has been constrained historically\nby water scarcity. Post-WWII technologies enabled farmers over the\nOgallala aquifer to extract groundwater for large-scale irrigation.\nComparing counties over the Ogallala with nearby similar counties,\ngroundwater access increased agricultural land values and initially\nreduced the impact of droughts. Over time, land use adjusted toward\nwater intensive crops and drought sensitivity increased. Viewed differently,\nfarmers in nearby water-scarce areas maintained lowervalue\ndrought-resistant practices that fully mitigate naturally higher\ndrought sensitivity. The evolving impact of the Ogallala illustrates\nthe importance of water for agricultural production, but also the\nlarge scope for agricultural adaptation to groundwater and drought.",
