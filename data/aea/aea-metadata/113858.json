    "description": "In cross-country data, teaching practices (such as copying from the\nboard versus working on projects together) are related to various\ndimensions of social capital. In micro-data from three datasets, teaching\npractices are also strongly correlated with student beliefs about\ncooperation across schools within countries. To address omitted variable\nand reverse causality concerns, we show that, within schools,\nteaching practices also have an independent and sizeable effect on student\nbeliefs. The evidence supports the idea that progressive education\npromotes the formation of social capital.",
