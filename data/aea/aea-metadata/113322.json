    "description": "We experimentally test an endogenous-timing investment model in which subjects\nprivately observe their cost of investing and a signal correlated with the\ncommon investment return. Subjects overinvest, relative to Nash. We separately\nconsider whether subjects draw inferences, in hindsight, and use foresight to\ndelay profitable investment and learn from market activity. In contrast to Nash,\ncursed equilibrium, and level-k predictions, behavior hardly changes across\nour experimental treatments. Maximum likelihood estimates are inconsistent\nwith belief-based theories. We offer an explanation in terms of boundedly rational\nrules of thumb, based on insights about the game, which provides a better fit\nthan quantal response equilibrium. (JEL C72, D82, D83, G11)",
