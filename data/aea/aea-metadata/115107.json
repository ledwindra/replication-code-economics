    "description": "Numerous cities have enacted electronic monitoring programs at traffic\nintersections in an effort to reduce the high number of vehicle accidents.\nThe rationale is that the higher expected fines for running a red light will\ninduce drivers to stop and lead to fewer cross-road collisions. However,\nthe cameras also incentivize drivers to accept a greater accident risk\nfrom stopping. We evaluate the termination of a monitoring program\nvia a voter referendum using 12 years of geocoded police accident data.\nWe find that the cameras changed the composition of accidents, but no\nevidence of a reduction in total accidents or injuries.nbsp;",
