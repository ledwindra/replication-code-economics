    "description": "We use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the parameters\nof a \u0093true\u0094 data-generating mechanism and those of a sequence of approximating\nmodels that a monetary authority uses to guide its decisions. Gaps between\na true expectational Phillips curve and the monetary authority\u0092s approximating\nnonexpectational Phillips curve models unleash inflation that a monetary authority\nthat knows the true model would avoid. A sequence of dynamic programming\nproblems implies that the monetary authority\u0092s inflation target evolves as its\nestimated Phillips curve moves. Our estimates attribute the rise and fall of post-\nWWII inflation in the United States to an intricate interaction between the monetary\nauthority\u0092s beliefs and economic shocks. Shocks in the 1970s made the monetary\nauthority perceive a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment which ignited big\ninflation. The monetary authority\u0092s beliefs about the Phillips curve changed in ways\nthat account for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker\u0092s conquest of U.S.\ninflation.
