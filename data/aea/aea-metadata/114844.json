    "description": "How likely is a catastrophic event that would substantially reduce\nthe capital stock, GDP, and wealth? How much should society be\nwilling to pay to reduce the probability or impact of a catastrophe?\nWe answer these questions and provide a framework for policy\nanalysis using a general equilibrium model of production, capital\naccumulation, and household preferences. Calibrating the model to\neconomic and financial data, we estimate the mean arrival rate of\nshocks and their size distribution, the tax on consumption society\nwould accept to limit the maximum size of a catastrophic shock, and\nthe cost to insure against its impact.",
