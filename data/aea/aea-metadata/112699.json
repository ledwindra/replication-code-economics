    "description": "This paper revisits the results of Moskowitz and Vissing-J\u00f8gensen\n(2002) on returns to entrepreneurial investments in the United States.\nFollowing the authors' methodology and new data from the Survey of\nConsumer Finances, I find that the \"private equity premium puzzle\"\ndoes not survive the period of high public equity returns in the 1990s.\nThe difference between private and public equity returns is positive\nand large period-by-period between 1999 and 2007. Whereas in\nthe 2008-2010 period, overlapping with the Great Recession,\npublic and private equities performances are substantially closer.\nI validate these results in the aggregate data going back to the 1960s.",
