    "description": "Private equity critics claim that leveraged buyouts bring huge job\nlosses and few gains in operating performance. To evaluate these\nclaims, we construct and analyze a new dataset that covers US\nbuyouts from 1980 to 2005. We track 3,200 target firms and their\n150,000 establishments before and after acquisition, comparing to\ncontrols defined by industry, size, age, and prior growth. Buyouts\nlead to modest net job losses but large increases in gross job creation\nand destruction. Buyouts also bring TFP gains at target firms,\nmainly through accelerated exit of less productive establishments\nand greater entry of highly productive ones.
