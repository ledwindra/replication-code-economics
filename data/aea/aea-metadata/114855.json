    "description": "We investigate whether women's political representation in state\nlegislatures improves public provision of antenatal and childhood\nhealth services in the districts from which they are elected, arguing\nthat the costs of poor services in this domain fall disproportionately\nupon women. Using large representative data samples from India and\naccounting for potential endogeneity of politician gender and the sample\ncomposition of births, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in\nwomen's representation results in a 2.1 percentage point reduction in\nneonatal mortality, and we elucidate mechanisms. Women's political\nrepresentation may be an underutilized tool for addressing health in\ndeveloping countries.",
