    "description": "We investigate Schelling's hypothesis that payoff-irrelevant labels\n(\"cues\") can influence the outcomes of bargaining games with\ncommunication. In our experimental games, players negotiate over\nthe division of a surplus by claiming valuable objects that have\npayoff-irrelevant spatial locations. Negotiation occurs in continuous\ntime, constrained by a deadline. In some games, spatial cues are\nopposed to principles of equality or efficiency. We find a strong tendency for players to agree on efficient and minimally unequal payoff divisions, even if spatial cues suggest otherwise. But if there are two such divisions, cues are often used to select between them, inducing distributional effects.",
