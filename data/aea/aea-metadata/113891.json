    "description": "We use an original panel dataset of migrant departures from the\nPhilippines to identify the responsiveness of migrant numbers\nand wages to GDP shocks in destination countries. We find a\nlarge, significant response of migrant numbers to GDP shocks at\ndestination, but no significant wage response. This is consistent\nwith binding minimum wages for migrant labor. This result implies\nthat labor market imperfections that make international migration\nattractive also make migrant flows more sensitive to global business\ncycles. Difference-in-differences analysis of a minimum wage change\nfor maids confirms that minimum wages bind and demand is price\nsensitive without these distortions.",
