    "description": "We combine survey data on friendship networks and individual\ncharacteristics with experimental observations from dictator games.\nDictator offers are primarily explained by social distance, giving\nfollows a simple inverse distance law. While student demographics\nplay a minor role in explaining offer amounts, individual heterogeneity\nis important for network formation. In particular, we detect\nsignificant homophilous behavior; students connect to others similar\nto themselves. Moreover, the network data reveal a strong preference\nfor cliques, students connect to those already close. The study is one\nof the first to identify network architecture with individual behavior\nin a strategic context. (JEL D44, H82)",
