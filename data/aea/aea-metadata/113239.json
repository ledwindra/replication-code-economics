    "description": "This laboratory experiment explores the extent to which impersonal exchange\nemerges from personal exchange with opportunities for long-distance trade.\nWe design a three-commodity production and exchange economy in which\nagents\nin three geographically separated villages must develop multilateral\nexchange networks to import a good only available abroad. For treatments,\nwe induce two distinct institutional histories to investigate how past\nexperience with property rights affects the evolution of specialization\nand exchange. We find that a history of unenforced property rights hinders\nour subjects' ability to develop the requisite personal social\narrangements to support specialization and effectively exploit impersonal\nlong-distance trade.",
