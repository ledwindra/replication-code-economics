    "description": "Mid-twentieth century malaria eradication campaigns largely eliminated\nmalaria from Paraguay and Sri Lanka. Using these interventions\nas quasi-experiments, I estimate malaria's effect on lifetime\nfemale educational attainment through the combination of pre-existing\ngeographic variation in malarial intensity and cohort exposure\nbased on the timing of the national anti-malaria campaigns. The\nestimates from Sri Lanka and Paraguay are similar and indicate\nthat malaria eradication increased years of educational attainment\nand literacy. The similarity of the estimates across the countries\nreinforces our confidence in the validity of the identification strategy.\n(JEL I12, I18, I21, J16, O15, O18)",
