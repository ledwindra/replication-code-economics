    "description": "A common concern with efforts to directly help\nsome small businesses to grow is that their growth comes at the expense of\ntheir unassisted competitors. We test this possibility using a two-stage\nrandomized experiment in Kenya which randomizes business training at the market\nlevel, and then within markets to selected businesses. Three years after\ntraining, the treated businesses are selling more, earn higher profits, and their\nowners have higher well-being. nbsp;Point\nestimates of the spillovers on the competing businesses are small and not\nstatistically significant, and the markets as a whole have grown in terms of sales\nvolume.This archive contains the original survey data, and Stata replication code needed to reproduce this paper.nbsp;",
