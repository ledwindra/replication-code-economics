    "description": "We examine the role an exogenous increase in household income,\ndue to a government transfer unrelated to household characteristics,\nplays in children's long-run outcomes. Children in affected households\nhave higher levels of education in their young adulthood and\na lower incidence of criminality for minor offenses. Effects differ by\ninitial household poverty status. An additional $4,000 per year for\nthe poorest households increases educational attainment by one year\nat age 21, and reduces the chances of committing a minor crime by\n22 percent for 16 and 17 year olds. Our evidence suggests improved\nparental quality is a likely mechanism for the change. (JEL D14,\nH23, I32, I38, J13)",
