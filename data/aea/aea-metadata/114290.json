    "description": "We present evidence on the frequency of nominal wage adjustment\nusing SIPP data adjusted for measurement error. The SIPP is a\nrepresentative sample of the US population. Our main results are:\n(i) The average quarterly probability of a nominal wage change\nis between 21.1 and 26.6 percent, depending on the assumptions\nused. (ii) Wage changes are much more likely when workers change\njobs. (iii) The frequency of wage adjustment does not display\nsignificant seasonal patterns. (iv) The hazard of a nominal wage\nchange first increases and then decreases, with a peak at 12 months.",
