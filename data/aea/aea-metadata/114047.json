    "description": "Assassinations are a persistent feature of the political landscape.\nUsing a new dataset of assassination attempts on all world leaders\nfrom 1875 to 2004, we exploit inherent randomness in the success\nor failure of assassination attempts to identify the effects of assassination.\nWe find that, on average, successful assassinations of\nautocrats produce sustained moves toward democracy. We also find\nthat assassinations affect the intensity of small-scale conflicts. The\nresults document a contemporary source of institutional change,\ninform theories of conflict, and show that small sources of randomness\ncan have a pronounced effect on history.
