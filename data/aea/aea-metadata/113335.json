    "description": "We explore patterns of vertical integration in the US airline industry. Major airlines\nsubcontract portions of their network to regional partners, which may or\nmay not be owned. We investigate if ownership economizes on ex post renegotiation\ncosts. We estimate whether airlines are more likely to use owned regionals\non city pairs with adverse weather (which makes adaptation decisions more\nfrequent) and on city pairs that are more integrated into the major's network\n(which raises the costs of having adaptation decisions resolved suboptimally).\nOur results suggest a robust empirical relationship between adaptation and\nvertical integration in this setting.
