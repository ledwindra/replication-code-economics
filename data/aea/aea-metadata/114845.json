    "description": "We investigate how cap-and-trade regulation affects profits. In late\nApril 2006, the EU CO2 allowance price dropped 50 percent, equating\nto a \u20ac28 billion reduction in the value of aggregate annual allowances.\nWe examine daily returns for 552 stocks from the EUROSTOXX\nindex. Despite reductions in environmental costs, we find that stock\nprices fell for firms in both carbon- and electricity-intensive industries,\nparticularly for firms selling primarily within the EU. Our\nresults imply that investors focus on product price impacts, rather\nthan just compliance costs and the nominal value of pollution permits.",
