    "description": "Using two strategies, we show that consumers underreact to taxes that are not\nsalient. First, using a field experiment in a grocery store, we find that posting\ntax-inclusive price tags reduces demand by 8 percent. Second, increases in taxes\nincluded in posted prices reduce alcohol consumption more than increases in\ntaxes applied at the register. We develop a theoretical framework for applied\nwelfare analysis that accommodates salience effects and other optimization\nfailures. The simple formulas we derive imply that the economic incidence of\na tax depends on its statutory incidence, and that even policies that induce no\nchange in behavior can create efficiency losses.
