    "description": "In all modern bureaucracies, politicians retain some discretion in public  employment  decisions,  which  may  lead  to  frictions  in  the selection  process  if  political  connections  substitute  for  individual competence.  Relying on detailed matched employer-employee data on the universe of public employees in Brazil over 1997-2014, and on a regression discontinuity design in close electoral races, we establish  three  main  findings.  First,  political  connections  are  a  key and  quantitatively  large  determinant  of  employment  in  public  organizations, for both bureaucrats and frontline providers.  Second, patronage  is  an  important  mechanism  behind  this  result.   Third, political  considerations  lead  to  the  selection  of  less  competent  individuals.",
