    "description": "We report 28 new experiment sessions consisting of up to three experience\nlevels to examine the robustness of learning and \"error\" elimination among\nparticipants in a laboratory asset market and its effect on price bubbles.\nOur answer to the title question is: \"yes.\" We impose a large increase in\nliquidity and dividend uncertainty to shock the environment of experienced\nsubjects who have converged to equilibrium, and this treatment rekindles a\nbubble. However, in replications of that same challenging environment\nacross three experience levels, we discover that the environment yields a\nrare residual tendency to bubble even in the third experience session.\nTherefore, a caveat must be placed on the effect of twice-experienced\nsubjects in asset markets: in order for price bubbles to be extinguished,\nthe environment in which the participants engage in exchange must be\nstationary and bounded by a range of parameters. Experience, including\npossible \"error\" elimination, is not robust to major new environment\nchanges in determining the characteristics of a price bubble.",
