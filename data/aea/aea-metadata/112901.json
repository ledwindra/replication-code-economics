    "description": "Regulatory oversight of toxic emissions from industrial plants and\nunderstanding about these emissions' impacts are in their infancy.\nApplying a research design based on the openings and closings of\n1,600 industrial plants to rich data on housing markets and infant\nhealth, we find that: toxic air emissions affect air quality only within\n1 mile of the plant; plant openings lead to 11 percent declines in\nhousing values within 0.5 mile or a loss of about $4.25 million\nfor these households; and a plant's operation is associated with\na roughly 3 percent increase in the probability of low birthweight\nwithin 1 mile.
