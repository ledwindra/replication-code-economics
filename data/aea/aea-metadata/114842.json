    "description": "Theoretical work on disciplining corrupt agents has emphasized\nthe role of expected future rents -- for example, efficiency wages. Yet\ntaken seriously this approach implies that illicit future rents should\nalso deter corruption. We study this \"golden goose\" effect in the\ncontext of a statutory wage increase in India's employment guarantee\nscheme, comparing official microrecords to original household\nsurvey data to measure corruption. We estimate large golden goose\neffects that reduced the total impact of the wage increase on theft\nby roughly 64 percent. In short, rent expectations matter.\n(JEL D73, D82, H83, J41, K42, O17, O21)",
