    "description": "We use scanner data and time diaries to document how households substitute time\nfor money through shopping and home production. We document substantial heterogeneity\nin prices paid for identical goods for the same area and time, with older\nhouseholds shopping the most and paying the lowest prices. Doubling shopping frequency\nlowers a good's price by 7 to 10 percent. We estimate the shopper's price of\ntime and use this series to estimate an elasticity of substitution between time and goods\nin home production of roughly 1.8. The observed life-cycle time allocation implies a\nconsumption series that differs markedly from expenditures. (JEL D12, D91)",
