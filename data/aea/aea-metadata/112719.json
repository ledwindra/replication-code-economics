    "description": "We study collective decisions by time-discounting individuals choosing\na common consumption stream. We show that with any heterogeneity\nin time preferences, utilitarian aggregation necessitates a\npresent bias. In lab experiments three quarters of \"social planners\"\nexhibited present biases, and less than two percent were time consistent. Roughly a third of subjects acted as if they were pure utilitarians, and the rest chose as if they also had varying degrees of\ndistributional concerns. (JEL C91, D12, D71, D72)",
