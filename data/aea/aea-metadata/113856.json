    "description": "This paper studies the impact of gender quotas for corporate\nboard seats on corporate decisions. We examine the introduction of\nNorway's 2006 quota, comparing affected firms to other Nordic companies,\npublic and private, that are unaffected by the rule. We find\nthat affected firms undertake fewer workforce reductions than comparison\nfirms, increasing relative labor costs and employment levels\nand reducing short-term profits. The effects are strongest among\nfirms without female board members beforehand and are present\neven for boards with older and more experienced members afterward.\nThe boards appear to be affecting corporate strategy in part\nby selecting like-minded executives.",
