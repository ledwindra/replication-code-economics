    "description": "This paper re-examines the effect of oil wealth on political violence.\nUsing a unique historical panel dataset of oil discoveries, we show\nthat simply controlling for country fixed effects removes the statistical\nassociation between the value of oil reserves and civil war onset.\nOther macro-political violence measures, such as coup attempts, are\nalso uncorrelated with oil wealth. To further address endogeneity\nconcerns, we exploit changes in oil reserves due to randomness in\nthe success of oil explorations. We find little robust evidence that oil\ndiscoveries increase the likelihood of political violence. Rather, oil\ndiscoveries increase military spending in nondemocratic countries.\n(JEL D74, H56, O17, Q34, Q41)",
