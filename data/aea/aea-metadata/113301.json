    "description": "The central insight of asset pricing is that a security's value depends both on\nits distribution of payoffs across economic states and on state prices. In fixed\nincome markets, many investors focus exclusively on estimates of expected\npayoffs, such as credit ratings, without considering the state of the economy\nin which default occurs. Such investors are likely to be attracted to securities\nwhose payoffs resemble economic catastrophe bonds\u2014bonds that default\nonly under severe economic conditions. We show that many structured finance\ninstruments can be characterized as economic catastrophe bonds, but offer far\nless compensation than alternatives with comparable payoff profiles.
