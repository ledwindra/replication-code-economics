    "description": "We invent Implicit Marshallian demands, which combine desirable features of\nHicksian and Marshallian demands. We propose and estimate the Exact Affine\nStone Index (EASI) implicit Marshallian demand system. Like the Almost Ideal\nDemand (AID) system, EASI budget shares are linear in parameters given real\nexpenditures. However, unlike the AID, EASI demands can have any rank and\nits Engel curves can have any shape over real expenditures. EASI error terms\nequal random utility parameters to account for unobserved preference heterogeneity.\nEASI demand functions can be estimated using GMM or three stage\nleast squares, and, like AID, an approximate EASI model can be estimated by\nlinear regression.
