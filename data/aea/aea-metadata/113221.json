    "description": "This paper presents a theory of establishment size dynamics based on the accumulation\nof industry-specific human capital that simultaneously rationalizes the economy-\nwide facts on establishment growth rates, exit rates, and size distributions. The\ntheory predicts that establishment growth and net exit rates should decline faster\nwith size, and that the establishment size distribution should have thinner tails, in\nsectors that use specific human capital less intensively. We establish that there is\nsubstantial cross-sector heterogeneity in US establishment size dynamics and distributions,\nwhich is well explained by relative factor intensities.
