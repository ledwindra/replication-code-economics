    "description": "Recent sovereign defaults are accompanied by interest rate spikes and deep\nrecessions. This paper develops a small open economy model to study default\nrisk and its interaction with output and foreign debt. Default\nprobabilities and interest rates depend on incentives for repayment.\nDefault is more likely in recessions because this is when it is more\ncostly for a risk averse borrower to repay noncontingent debt. The model\nclosely matches business cycles in Argentina predicting high volatility of\ninterest rates, higher volatility of consumption relative to output, and\nnegative correlations of output with interest rates and the trade balance.",
