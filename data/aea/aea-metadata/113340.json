    "description": "This paper presents evidence about the effect of individual monetary incentives\non English and math teachers in Israel. Teachers were rewarded with cash\nbonuses for improving their students' performance in high-school matriculation\nexams. The main identification strategy is based on measurement error\nin the assignment to treatment variable that produced a randomized treatment\nsample. The incentives led to significant improvements in test taking rates, conditional\npass rates, and mean test scores. Improvements were mediated through\nchanges in teaching methods, enhanced after-school teaching, and increased\nresponsiveness to students' needs. No evidence was found of manipulation of\ntest scores by teachers. (JEL I21, J31, J45)",
