    "description": "We investigate the consequences of demographic change for business cycle\nanalysis. We find that changes in the age composition of the labor force account\nfor a significant fraction of the variation in cyclical volatility observed in the\nG7. Since World War II, these countries have experienced dramatic demographic\nchanges, although details regarding timing and nature differ across\ncountries. We exploit this variation to show that the workforce age composition\nhas a large and significant effect on cyclical volatility. We relate our results to\nthe recent decline in US macroeconomic volatility, finding that demographic\nchange accounts for approximately one-fifth to one-third of this moderation.\n(JEL E32, J11)",
