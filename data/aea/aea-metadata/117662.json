    "description": "We construct a structural model of on-the-job search in which workersdiffer in skills along several dimensions and sort themselves intojobs with heterogeneous skill requirements along those same dimensions.Skills are accumulated when used, and depreciate when not used. Weestimate the model combining data from O{*}NET with the NLSY79. Weuse the model to shed light on the origins and costs of mismatch alongheterogeneous skill dimensions. We highlight the deficiencies of relyingon a unidimensional model of skill when decomposing the sources ofvariation in the value of lifetime output between initial conditionsand career shocks.",
