    "description": "We construct a utility-based model of fluctuations with nominal\nrigidities and unemployment. We first show that under a standard\nutility specification, productivity shocks have no effect on unemployment\nin the constrained efficient allocation. That property is also\nshown to hold, despite labor market frictions, in the decentralized\nequilibrium under flexible prices and wages. Inefficient unemployment\nfluctuations arise when we introduce real-wage rigidities. As a\nresult, in the presence of staggered price setting by firms, the central\nbank faces a trade-off between inflation and unemployment stabilization,\nwhich depends on labor market characteristics. We draw the\nimplications for optimal monetary policy. (JEL E12, E24, E52)",
