    "description": "We examine how employers learn about worker productivity in a\nrandomized pilot experiment which provided objective estimates of\nteacher performance to school principals. We test several hypotheses\nthat support a simple Bayesian learning model with imperfect\ninformation. First, the correlation between performance estimates\nand prior beliefs rises with more precise objective estimates and more\nprecise subjective priors. Second, new information exerts greater\ninfluence on posterior beliefs when it is more precise and when\npriors are less precise. Employer learning affects job separation and\nproductivity in schools, increasing turnover for teachers with low\nperformance estimates and producing small test score improvements.\n(JEL D83, I21, J24, J45)",
