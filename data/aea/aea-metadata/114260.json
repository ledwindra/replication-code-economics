    "description": "Exploiting the Japanese banking crisis of the 1990s as a laboratory,\nwe investigate the effects of bank bailouts on the supply of credit and\nthe performance of banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clients. Our findings indicate that the size\nof capital injections relative to the initial financial condition of banks\nis crucial for the success of bank bailouts. Capital injections that are\nlarge enough to reestablish bank capital requirements increase the\nsupply of credit and spur investment. In contrast, not only do capital\ninjections that are too small fail to increase the supply of credit,\nbut they also encourage the evergreening of nonperforming loans.\n(JEL E44, G21, G28, G32, G34)",
