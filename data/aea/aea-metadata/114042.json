    "description": "High interest rate currencies tend to appreciate relative to low\ninterest rate currencies. We argue that adverse selection problems\nbetween participants in foreign exchange markets can account for\nthis \"forward premium puzzle.\" The key feature of our model is that\nthe adverse selection problem facing market makers is worse when\nan agent wants to trade against a public information signal. So, when\nbased on public information, the currency is expected to appreciate,\nthere is more adverse selection associated with a sell order than with\na buy order. (JEL E43, F31, G15)",
