    "description": "France, Germany, and Sweden link taxes to passenger vehicles' carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions rates. Based on new vehicle registration data from 2005 to 2010, we find that CO2 taxes reduce registrations. The effect is larger in France than in either Germany or Sweden, and the French results are robust to alternative estimation models. Compared with those of France, the German results vary somewhat more, and the Swedish estimates are the least robust. We find some evidence that the French tax affected the mix of new vehicles that vehicle manufacturers offered in the French market. (JEL H23, L62, Q54, Q58)",
