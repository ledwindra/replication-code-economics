    "description": "Historical accounts suggest that Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Nazi Germany\nrevolutionized US science. To analyze the \u00e9migr\u00e9s' effects on chemical\ninnovation in the United States, we compare changes in patenting\nby US inventors in research fields of \u00e9migr\u00e9s with fields of other\nGerman chemists. Patenting by US inventors increased by 31 percent\nin \u00e9migr\u00e9 fields. Regressions which instrument for \u00e9migr\u00e9 fields with\npre-1933 fields of dismissed German chemists confirm a substantial\nincrease in US invention. Inventor-level data indicate that \u00e9migr\u00e9s\nencouraged innovation by attracting new researchers to their fields,\nrather than by increasing the productivity of incumbent inventors.",
