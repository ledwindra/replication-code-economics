    "description": "We develop and estimate an equilibrium job search model of worker careers, allowing for human capital accumulation, employer heterogeneity and individual-level shocks. Wage growth is decomposed into contributions of human capital and job search,\nwithin and between jobs. Human capital accumulation is largest\nfor highly educated workers. The contribution from job search to\nwage growth, both within- and between-job, declines over the first\nten years of a career \u2013 the \u2018job-shopping\u2019 phase of a working life \u2013 after which workers settle into high-quality jobs using outside offers to generate gradual wage increases, thus reaping the benefits from competition between employers.",
