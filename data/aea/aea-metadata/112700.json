    "description": "To combat adverse selection, governments increasingly base payments to health plans and providers on enrollees' scores from\nrisk-adjustment formulae. In 2004, Medicare began to risk-adjust\ncapitation payments to private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to\nreduce selection-driven overpayments. But because the variance\nof medical costs increases with the predicted mean, incentivizing\nenrollment of individuals with higher scores can increase the scope\nfor enrolling \"overpriced\" individuals with costs significantly below\nthe formula's prediction. Indeed, after risk adjustment, MA plans\nenrolled individuals with higher scores but lower costs conditional\non their score. We find no evidence that overpayments were on net\nreduced.",
