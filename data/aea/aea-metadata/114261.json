    "description": "Time use data on work and leisure is presented for a broad group\nof OECD countries. The home production model explicitly accounts\nfor taxes and public expenditures on day care and elder care, substitutes for work households perform at home. Taxes are important\nfor matching time use patterns in Canada, the UK, and continental\nEurope, but cannot explain the high levels of market work and low\nlevels of home work observed in Scandinavia. Subsidies of services\nlike day care that substitute for home work are shown to be quantitatively important for bringing both market and home work predictions in line with the data.
