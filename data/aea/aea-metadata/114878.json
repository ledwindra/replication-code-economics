    "description": "This paper analyzes the efficiency of and the substitutability between\nthree urban congestion management policies: transit subsidization,\ncar congestion pricing, and dedicated bus lanes. The model features\nuser heterogeneity, cross-congestion effects between cars and transit,\nintertemporal and total transport demand elasticities, and is\nsimulated using data for London, UK and Santiago, Chile. We find\nthat the substitutability between policies is large and, in particular,\nthe marginal contribution of increased transit subsidies, as other\npolicies are implemented first, diminishes rapidly. Bus lanes are an\nattractive way to increase frequencies and decrease fares without\ninjecting public funds.",
