    "description": "Existing studies establish a strong cross-country correlation between income\nand democracy but do not control for factors that simultaneously affect both\nvariables. We show that controlling for such factors by including country\nfixed effects removes the statistical association between income per\ncapita and various measures of democracy. We present\ninstrumental-variables estimates that also show no causal effect of income\non democracy. The cross-country correlation between income and democracy\nreflects a positive correlation between changes in income and democracy\nover the past 500 years. This pattern is consistent with the idea that\nsocieties embarked on divergent political-economic development paths at\ncertain critical junctures.",
