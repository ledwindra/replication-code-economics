    "description": "This paper measures the demand for adult medical male circumcision\nusing an experiment that randomly offered varying-priced subsidies\nand comprehensive information to 1,600 uncircumcised men in\nurban Malawi. We find low demand for male circumcision: only\n3 percent are circumcised over a three month period. Despite the low\noverall level of take-up, both price and information are significant\ndeterminants of circumcision. Still, the main barriers to male\ncircumcision-cultural norms and fear of pain-are not affected\nby prices or information. Significant demand generation efforts are\nneeded for this HIV prevention strategy to be effective.",
