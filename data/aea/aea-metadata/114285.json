    "description": "We empirically establish that one-third of job transitions leads to wage\nlosses. Using a quantitative on-the-job search model, we find that\n60 percent of them are movements down the job ladder. Accounting\nfor them, our baseline calibration matches the large residual wage\ninequality in US data while attributing only 13.7 percent of overall\nwage inequality to the presence of search frictions in the labor\nmarket. We can trace the difference between ours and previous much\nhigher estimates to our explicit modeling of nonvalue improving\njob-to-job transitions.",
