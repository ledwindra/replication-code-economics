    "description": "We evaluate a 'girl-friendly' primary school program in Burkina\nFaso using a regression discontinuity design. After 2.5 years, the program\nincreased enrollment by 19 percentage points and increased\ntest scores by 0.41 standard deviations. For those caused to attend\nschool, scores increased by 2.2 standard deviations. Girls' enrollment\nincreased by 5 percentage points more than boys' enrollment,\nbut they experienced the same increase in test scores as boys. The\nunique characteristics of the schools are responsible for increasing\nenrollment by 13 percentage points and test scores by 0.35 standard\ndeviations. They account for the entire difference in the treatment\neffects by gender.",
