    "description": "Do low property taxes attract new home construction? This question is answered using a large shock to property tax burdens caused by an unusual school finance reform in the state of New Hampshire. The estimates suggest that, in most of the state, communities with a reduced tax burden experience a substantial increase in residential construction. In the area of the state near the region's primary urban center (Boston), however, the shock clears through a price adjustment\u2014i.e., by capitalizing into property values. The differing responses are attributed to differing housing supply elasticities. (JEL H71, H73, R31)",
