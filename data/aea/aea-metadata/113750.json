    "description": "We examine the effects of exposure to malaria in early childhood\non educational attainment and economic status in adulthood by\nexploiting geographic variation in malaria prevalence in India prior\nto a nationwide eradication program in the 1950s. We find that the\nprogram led to modest increases in household per capita consumption\nfor prime age men, and the effects for men are larger than those\nfor women in most specifications. We find no evidence of increased\neducational attainment for men and mixed evidence for women.\n(JEL I12, I18, I21, 015, 018)",
