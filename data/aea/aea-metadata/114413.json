    "description": "Previous research has suggested that codeshare agreements\neliminate double marginalization that exists when unaffiliated\nairlines independently determine the price for different segments\nof an interline trip. Using a structural econometric model, this\npaper investigates whether codeshare contracts do eliminate\ndouble marginalization. The results suggest that both upstream\nand downstream margins persist when the operating carrier of a\ncodeshare product also offers competing single-carrier product(s) in\nthe concerned market. Furthermore, counterfactual simulations from\nthe model suggest that efficient pricing of these codeshare products\nwould lower their price, and yield nontrivial increases in consumer\nwelfare.",
