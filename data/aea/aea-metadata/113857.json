    "description": "Individuals dominate money in politics, accounting for over 90 percent\nof campaign contributions, yet studies of drivers of individuals' giving\nare scarce. We analyze data on all contributions made between 1991\nand 2008 by all 1,556 people who became SP 500 CEOs during\nthat interval. We exploit variation in leadership status over these\nindividuals' careers to identify that being an SP 500 CEO causes\na $4,029 or 137 percent jump per election cycle in personal giving.\nWhile some fraction of CEOs' contributions can be attributed to\nlong-standing preferences, the striking changes in behavior cannot\nbe explained by these factors alone.",
