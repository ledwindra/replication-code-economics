    "description": "Micro-entrepreneurs often lack the financial literacy required to\nmake important financial decisions. We conducted a randomized\nevaluation with a bank in the Dominican Republic to compare the\nimpact of two distinct programs: standard accounting training\nversus a simplified, rule-of-thumb training that taught basic financial\nheuristics. The rule-of-thumb training significantly improved\nfirms' financial practices, objective reporting quality, and revenues.\nFor micro-entrepreneurs with lower skills or poor initial financial\npractices, the impact of the rule-of-thumb training was significantly\nlarger than that of the standard accounting training, suggesting that\nsimplifying training programs might improve their effectiveness for\nless sophisticated individuals.",
