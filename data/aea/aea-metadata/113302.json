    "description": "We examine the impacts of increased US gasoline taxes in a model that links\nthe markets for new, used, and scrapped vehicles and recognizes the considerable\nheterogeneity among households and cars. Household choice parameters\nderive from an estimation procedure that integrates individual choices for car\nownership and miles traveled. We find that each cent-per-gallon increase in the\nprice of gasoline reduces the equilibrium gasoline consumption by about 0.2\npercent. Taking account of revenue recycling, the impact of a 25-cent gasoline\ntax increase on the average household is about $30 per year (2001 dollars).\nDistributional impacts depend importantly on how additional revenues from\nthe tax increase are recycled.
