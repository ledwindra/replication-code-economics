    "description": "With the use of French and US data, new and systematic evidence is provided about\nthe rapid location changes of industries across cities (the fast). Cities are also\nslowly moving up and down the urban hierarchy (the slow), while the size distribution\nof cities is skewed to the right and very stable (the still). The model proposed\nhere reproduces these three features. Small, innovation-driven shocks lead to the\nchurning of industries across cities. Then, cities slowly grow or decline following\nnet gains or losses of industries. These changes occur within a stable distribution.\nThe quantitative implications of the model are also explored.
