    "description": "We use a regression discontinuity design to examine students'\nresponses to being placed on academic probation. Consistent with\na model of introducing performance standards, we find that being\nplaced on probation at the end of the first year discourages some\nstudents from returning to school while improving the GPAs of\nthose who do. We find heterogeneous responses across prior academic\nperformance, gender, and native language, and discuss these\nresults within the context of the model. We also find negative effects\non graduation rates, particularly for students with the highest high\nschool grades. (JEL I23, J16)",
