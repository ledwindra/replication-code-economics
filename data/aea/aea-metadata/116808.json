    "description": "We study the relationship between physician organizational structures and prices negotiated with private insurers.  \nUsing variation caused by state-level judicial law changes, we show that a 10% increase in the enforceability of non-compete agreements (NCAs) causes 4.3% higher physician prices, and declines in practice sizes and concentration.  \nUsing two databases containing every physician establishment and firm between 1996 and 2007, linked to negotiated prices, we show that larger practices have lower prices for services with high fixed costs, consistent with economies of scale.\nIn contrast, increases in firm concentration conditional on establishment concentration leads to higher prices.",
