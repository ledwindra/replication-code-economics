    "description": "We analyze a game of two-sided private information where players\nhave privately known \"strengths\" and can decide to fight or compromise.\nIf either chooses to fight, the stronger player receives a high\npayoff and the weaker player receives a low payoff. If both choose\nto compromise, each player receives an intermediate payoff. The\nonly equilibrium is for players to always fight. In our experiment, we\nobserve frequent compromise, more fighting the lower the compromise\npayoff and less fighting by first than second movers. We explore\nseveral theories of cognitive limitations in an attempt to understand\nthese anomalous findings. (JEL C91, D82)",
