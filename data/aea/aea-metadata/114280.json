    "description": "Empirical evidence on the relationship between democracy and\neconomic reforms is limited to few reforms, countries, and years.\nThis paper studies the effect of democracy on the adoption of economic\nreforms using a new dataset on reforms in the financial, capital\nand banking sectors, product markets, agriculture, and trade for\n150 countries over the period 1960-2004. Democracy has a positive\nand significant impact on the adoption of economic reforms, but\nthere is scarce evidence that economic reforms foster democracy.\nOur results are robust to the inclusion of a large variety of controls\nand estimation strategies.",
