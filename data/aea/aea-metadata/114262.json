    "description": "We provide a dynamic extension of an economy with search on credit\nand labor markets (Wasmer and Weil 2004). Financial frictions create\nvolatility. They add an additional, almost acyclical, entry cost to\nprocyclical job creation costs, thus increasing the elasticity of labor\nmarket tightness to productivity shocks by a factor of five to eight,\ncompared to a matching economy with perfect financial markets.\nWe characterize a dynamic financial multiplier that is increasing in\ntotal financial costs and minimized under a credit market Hosios-\nPissarides rule. Financial frictions are an element of the solution to\nthe volatility puzzle. (JEL C78, E24, E32, E44, G21, J63)",
