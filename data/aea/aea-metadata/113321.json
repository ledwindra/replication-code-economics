    "description": "We develop a general equilibrium model in which stock prices of innovative\nfirms exhibit \"bubbles\" during technological revolutions. In the model, the\naverage productivity of a new technology is uncertain and subject to learning.\nDuring technological revolutions, the nature of this uncertainty changes from\nidiosyncratic to systematic. The resulting bubbles in stock prices are observable\nex post but unpredictable ex ante, and they are most pronounced for technologies\ncharacterized by high uncertainty and fast adoption. We find empirical\nsupport for the model's predictions in 1830-1861 and 1992-2005 when the\nrailroad and Internet technologies spread in the United States. (JEL G12, L86,\nL92, N21, N22, N71, N72)",
