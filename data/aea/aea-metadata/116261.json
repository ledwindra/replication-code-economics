    "description": "This paper measures the economic impact of climate change on US agricultural\nland by estimating the effect of random year-to-year variation in temperature and\nprecipitation on agricultural profits. The preferred estimates indicate that climate\nchange will increase annual profits by $1.3 billion in 2002 dollars (2002$) or 4\npercent. This estimate is robust to numerous specification checks and relatively\nprecise, so large negative or positive effects are unlikely. We also find the hedonic\napproach\u0097which is the standard in the previous literature\u0097to be unreliable because\nit produces estimates that are extremely sensitive to seemingly minor choices\nabout control variables, sample, and weighting.
