    "description": "We conduct likelihood evaluation of a DSGE model in which firms\nhave imperfect common knowledge. Imperfect common knowledge\nis found to be more successful than price stickiness \u00e1\u00a0la Calvo to\naccount for the highly persistent effects of nominal shocks on output\nand inflation. Our likelihood analysis suggests that firms pay\nlittle attention to aggregate nominal conditions. This paper shows\nthat such allocation of attention is plausible because it is optimal for\nfirms with a reasonably small size of information frictions and a size\nof idiosyncratic uncertainty that is in line with the micro evidence on\nprice changes.",
