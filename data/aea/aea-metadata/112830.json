    "description": "This paper investigates the effect of early exposure to neighborhood crime on\nsubsequent criminal behavior of youth exploiting a unique natural experiment between 1986 and\n1998 when refugee immigrants to Denmark were assigned to neighborhoods quasi-randomly. We\nfind strong evidence that the share of young people convicted for crimes, in particular violent\ncrimes, in the neighborhood increases convictions of male assignees later in life. No such effects\nare found for other measures of neighborhood crime including the rate of committed crimes. Our\nfindings suggest social interaction as a key channel through which neighborhood crime is linked\nto individual criminal behavior.",
