    "description": "Market outcomes depend on the quality of information available to\nits participants. We measure the effect of information disclosure on\nmarket outcomes using a large-scale field experiment that randomly\ndiscloses quality information in wholesale automobile auctions. We\nargue that buyers in this market are horizontally differentiated across\ncars that are vertically ranked by quality. This implies that information\ndisclosure helps match heterogeneous buyers to cars of varying quality, causing both good and bad news to increase competition and revenues. The data confirm these hypotheses. These findings have implications for the design of other markets, including e-commerce, procurement auctions, and labor markets. (JEL C93, D44, D82, L15)",
