    "description": "This study uses the malaria-eradication campaigns in the United\nStates (circa 1920) and in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico (circa 1955)\nto measure how much childhood exposure to malaria depresses\nlabor productivity. The campaigns began because of advances in\nhealth technology, which mitigates concerns about reverse causality.\nMalarious areas saw large drops in the disease thereafter. Relative\nto non-malarious areas, cohorts born after eradication had higher\nincome as adults than the preceding generation. These cross-cohort\nchanges coincided with childhood exposure to the campaigns rather\nthan to pre-existing trends. Estimates suggest a substantial, though\nnot predominant, role for malaria in explaining cross-region differences\nin income. (JEL I12, I18, J13, O15)",
