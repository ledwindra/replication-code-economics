    "description": "Many experts speculate that US antitrust policy towards horizontal\nmergers has been too lenient. We estimate the price effects of\nWhirlpool's acquisition of Maytag to provide new evidence on this\ndebate. We compare price changes in appliance markets most affected\nby the merger to markets where concentration changed much less or\nnot at all. We estimate price increases for dishwashers and relatively\nlarge price increases for clothes dryers, but no price effects for refrigerators or clothes washers. The combined firm's market share fell\nacross all four affected categories, and the number of distinct appliance products offered for sale fell. (JEL G34, K21, L11, L41, L68)",
