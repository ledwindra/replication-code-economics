    "description": "This paper reports the results of an experiment on exclusive contracts. We replicate\nthe strategic environment described by Rasmusen, Ramseyer, and Wiley\n(1991) and Segal and Whinston (2000). Our findings are as follows. First, when\nthe buyers can communicate, discrimination raises the likelihood of exclusion.\nSecond, when the incumbent seller is unable to discriminate and must make\nthe same offers to the buyers, communication reduces the likelihood of exclusion.\nCommunication also induces more generous offers when the seller cannot\ndiscriminate, and divide-and-conquer offers when the seller can discriminate.\nThird, when communication is allowed, payoff endogeneity increases the likelihood\nof exclusion.
