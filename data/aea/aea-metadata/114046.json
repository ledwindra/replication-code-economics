    "description": "Accounting for observed fluctuations in aggregate employment, consumption,\nand real wage using the optimality conditions of a representative\nhousehold requires preferences that are incompatible with\neconomic priors. In order to reconcile theory with data, we construct\na model with heterogeneous agents whose decisions are difficult to\naggregate because of incomplete capital markets and the indivisible\nnature of labor supply. If we were to explain the model-generated\naggregate time series using decisions of a stand-in household, such\na household must have a nonconcave or unstable utility as is often\nfound with the aggregate US data.
